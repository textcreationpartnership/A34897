         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Theodoricus</hi> King of the <hi>Gothes</hi> ſolliciting for the Arians, Juſtinian, <hi>Novell. 42.</hi> When <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> was ſomewhat indulgent to Arianiſm, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors whereof denyes the deity of Chriſt, <hi>Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lochius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Iconium</hi> having ſuffered a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer repulſe, aſſaulted him with this Stratagem; entering his preſence, ſaluted him with due reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, but ſlighted his ſon <hi>Arcadius</hi> compeer in the Empire with him, at which the Father was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, till the grave man replyed, Art thou of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended O Emperour, that I attribute not to thy ſon equall honour with thy ſelf? and doſt thou not think that God is angry at thoſe, that aſcribe not equall glory to his ſon Chriſt with himſelf? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he was convinced to act new Laws againſt the Arians, <hi>Zozom. lib. 7. cap. 6.</hi>

            <p>Mixture of religion hath been adjudged dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous for many reaſons, firſt, it diſſolves the bond of obedience, unrivets the ſacred tye of love a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſubjects, breeds exacerbation of mind, and exulceration of affections, lays ſecret trains, and privie mines, for tumults, uproars, ſeditions, maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacres, and civill wars, as in <hi>Germany,</hi> where the Anabaptiſt grew ſo populous, that (as <hi>Sleiden</hi> records) they could not be vanquiſhed, till almoſt a hundred thouſand of them were ſlain by the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted forces of the Empire, <hi>Sleid. lib. 7.</hi> Secondly colluſion in religion, and immunity of profeſſion hath been the Prodrome, and Harbinger of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion,
<pb facs="tcp:45475:7"/> and ruin of the greateſt States, and moſt flouriſhing Churches: The Sects of the Phariſees, Sadduces, Eſſenes, and Herodians were a Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick <hi>Criſis</hi> of the Jewiſh diſſolution; The diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of opinions without reſtraint in the Emperour <hi>Heraclius</hi> his time, gave fuell, and fomentation to the Embrio of Mahometan ſuperſtition, and the Apoſtacie of the Eaſtern Churches. Thirdly it hath been the cauſe of defection, and ruin of the moſt famous Churches; for the Pagan, and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate Emperours, becauſe they would ſupplant the true Chriſtian profeſſion, granted liberty, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity unto all Sects of Hereticks; So <hi>Iulian</hi> at the requeſt of <hi>Rogatianus,</hi> and <hi>Ponticus,</hi> granted liberty of perdition (ſo <hi>Optatus Milevitanus</hi> calles it) unto the Sect of <hi>Donatus,</hi> thinking by that means to root out the Chriſtian name from off the earth, and envying the unity of the Church, from which he fell, freely permitted all ſacrilegious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention, <hi>Optat. cont. Parm. lib. 2.</hi> Fourthly, it brings a judgement upon thoſe Princes, who for ſiniſter ends tolerate Hereticks, and Idolaters; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe Kingdoms, or Common-wealths, where Hereſie, and Idolatrie is exerciſed: <hi>Gregory Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzene</hi> relates that <hi>Conſtantius</hi> falling into an Apoplexie, before his death repented of three things too late. 1. That he had elected <hi>Julian</hi> to be <hi>Caeſar. 2.</hi> That he had baniſhed <hi>Athanaſius. 3.</hi> That he had granted toleration of religions;
<pb facs="tcp:45475:7"/> 
               <hi>Iulian</hi> was wounded to death with an arrow in <hi>Perſia,</hi> as he was advancing his army, throwing out handfulls of blood into the skie, and crying <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

            <p>But why do I preſs theſe things? holding out my gloe-worme amongſt ſo many ſhining tapers? knowing we live under authority that is ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſe to diſtinguiſh betwixt truth, and errour, conſcientiouſly carefull to put a difference between tenderneſs, and obſtinacie; He that ſearches the heart, bears me record, that I urge them with no further approbation, than may ſuit with the glory of God, advancement of truth, and Peace of the Nation; Nor would I wiſh any further influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon the Anabaptiſts, than on my ſelf, were I in their condition, which is firſt, that they may be enlightned, and convinced, or if not ſo, that they
<pb facs="tcp:45475:8"/> would peaceably keep their Tenets to themſelves, &amp; not corrode further, like Gangrenes infecting the ſound parts; which is the end of this my writing; Not that I can adde any thing to what hath been formerly diſcuſſed; or that my weak endeavours may be compared to the learned labours that are gone before; But that divine providence hath ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, I was called ſuddainly to a conflict with the greateſt Beauclerk of the faction, and God giving ſucceſs to the honeſtneſs of the intention beyond the means, The relation of the diſpute, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon were put in Print, which he in his Plea for Anti Paedobaptiſts hath endeavoured to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw; Hence divers godly perſons (ſome out of ſcruple of conſcience, others for other motives) have importuned me to reply; which I humbly preſent unto your view deſiring that it may be protected under the ſhadow of your wings; And if I may contribute any thing to the diſcovery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and making plain the truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have the fruit of my labour, and my wiſh, who deſire to live to no other end, than to do ſervice to Gods Church, my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and your Honours in the quality of</p>

Secondly, Mr. <hi>Tombs,</hi> for bringing him in this laſt Cataſtrophe wounded in the heel by <hi>Troilus</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi> who vaunts that in former Scenes, (like <hi>Achilles,</hi> ſo far as he was dipped in the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver by his Mother <hi>Thetis</hi>) he hath been unpier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the Weapons of the ſtouteſt <hi>Hectors.</hi> Thirdly, Mr. <hi>Cragge,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Vaughan,</hi> for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing their Diſputes, conceived in an hour and an half, and the Sermon contrived in a day and a half, to long cenſure. Fourthly, the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts (as they will deem) for too uncourteouſly galling their ſoars. Fiftly, their Adverſaries the Paedobaptiſts, for too courteouſly, or (as they will fancy) partially concealing Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> harſh language, and his Favourites Incivilities. Sixtly, the Learned in general, for bringing theſe <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>-like hatched Births in a moment into the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
<pb facs="tcp:45475:9"/> Amphitheater with thoſe Elephants that have been ten years in conception.

The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of this is facile, the language plain, ſome will underſtand this, that cannot them.

               <p>INfants may lawfully be Baptized; for they be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the covenant of grace now by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, as they were before, and under the Law, admitted into the ſame covenant by Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>I deny your conſequence.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>V.</speaker>
               <p>You muſt deny it, either becauſe the covenant of grace made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his ſeed, is not the ſame in ſubſtance with that which is now actually in force with beleevers, and their Children, or Secondly becauſe Baptiſm ſucceedeth not in the room of Circumciſion.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>I could deny your diviſion: yet I ſay, to gratifie you, for both thoſe reaſons.</p>

               <p>For the former. That the covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his ſeed, is the ſame which is now actually in force with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, appears by comparing <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 17. 2. with <hi>Galat.</hi> 3. 14. where it is clearly ſet forth, that the promiſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> came unto the <hi>Gentiles</hi> through <hi>Jeſus Christ.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Here he distinguiſheth of a towfold ſeed of</hi> Abraham, <hi>the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, and ſpirituall, and ſaith, that the covenant was made with</hi> Abrahams <hi>ſpirituall ſeed, and not the naturall.</hi>

               <p>Even all the children of <hi>Abraham</hi> were Circumciſed, and conſequently admitted into the covenant, not one excepted; for every Man-child was to be Circumciſed, <hi>Gen</hi> 17. 10. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by what hapned to <hi>Moſes</hi> for not Circumciſing his Child, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4, 24. Even <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was circumciſed <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 17. 23. who

               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>Iſhmael, <hi>and the naturall Children of</hi> Abraham <hi>were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the externall part, namely outward priviledges, and temporall bleſſings, and not to the internall, or ſpirituall part thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the Internall part he muſt needs mean that part of it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. in theſe words, <hi>To be a God unto thee, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy ſeed after thee,</hi> and in the end of <hi>v. 8. I will be their God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To juſtifie this his deſtinction, he referred us to <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. and I think <hi>v.</hi> 8. where the Children of the promiſe are contradiſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from the Children of the fleſh, or the naturall Children of <hi>Abraham;</hi> So that the covenant was made not to the naturall Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but to ſuch of them as were elect, and faithfull.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>V.</speaker>
               <p>This covenant was made alike in the ſame extent, and lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude promiſcuouſly with all the ſeed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> and thoſe that loſt the promiſe, and the benefit of this covenant (which men you call the naturall ſeed loſt it not,) becauſe they were not at firſt comprehended in the covenant, but becauſe of their own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleef, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 20. I confeſſe that the children of <hi>Iſaac</hi> are, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. called the Children of the promiſe, not in regard of any peremptory election, or deſignation to Faith, and Salvation, or on the contrary of any abſolute reprobation of the ſeed of <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For if it had been <hi>Pauls</hi> deſigne to declare the Children of <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> yea, the greateſt part of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> to have been rejected by a certain abſolute decree, why ſhould he <hi>v.</hi> 1. 2. ſo much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment their incredulitie? wiſh himſelf accurſed for their ſakes, <hi>v.</hi> 3. and <hi>Rom. 10. v.</hi> 1. deſire, and pray for their converſion? ſince upon ſuch an abſolute decree of reprobating them, all that happened to them was inevitable.</p>
               <p>But the Children of <hi>Iſaac</hi> are called the Children of promiſe, Firſt, becauſe they onely were to inherite the land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> and Secondly, becauſe Chriſt according to the fleſh was to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend from the progenie of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> not of <hi>Iſhmael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I might have added, that if none but the elect, and faithfull, can be admitted into the covenant, there is no ſubject left for the ordinance of Baptiſm, it being impoſſible for man to know who are elect, ſpirituall, and true believers. Neither can you Baptize with right, or ſafety, all ſuch grown perſons as you Baptize, ſince you cannot be aſſured that they are elect, Spirituall or true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, (<hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 17.) nor have any light to guide you, ſave that of charitable opinion, and conjecture.</p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:45475:10"/>
               <p>Again, it being admitted that none but the Spirituall, elect, and believing, can be Baptized, the ſame charitie that ſwayes your judgment for grown perſons, muſt much rather move you to hope the beſt of innocent infants, guiltie of no actuall ſin, ſince it hopes all things, and thinks no evill, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 2. They may have faith (<hi>in ſemine &amp; habitu</hi>) in the ſeed (as they have the habit of principles, and reaſon) though they cannot exerciſe it till ripe years. 3. Though they have not actuall faith, yet the faith of their parents may, and doth, put them into a capacitie of being admitted into the covenant, nor is it news that the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents faith advantageth the Children. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 50.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>I could wiſh you could prove that Infants of believers might be admitted to Baptiſm by virtue of their parents faith.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>V.</speaker>
               <p>They were admitted into the ſame covenant by Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, into which we are admitted now by Baptiſm, but Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion is a <hi>ſeal of the righteouſneſs of faith, Rom.</hi> 4. 11. 12. Whence it will follow, that either they had the righteouſneſs of faith inherently in themſelves, or that of their parents impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them (chuſe you whether) or elſe it will follow that Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion was a falſe ſeal.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is not ſaid there that Circumciſion was the ſeal of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Childrens faith, but onely of</hi> Abrahams <hi>own faith in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>V.</speaker>
               <p>But the covenant, or promiſe, was the ſame and alike to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his ſeed, <hi>Rom. 4. 13. Gen.</hi> 17. 7. and alike to us believers, and to our Children, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 39.</p>
               <p>2. This truth appears yet further from. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. Where we find that the faith of either of the parents make the Children holy, at leaſt in that degree of holyneſs (which is the meaneſt imaginable) to be in capacitie of being admitted into the ſame covenant with their Parents.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The ſcope of the</hi> Apoſtle <hi>here, is to ſatiſfie a ſcruple of the</hi> Corinth. viz. <hi>whether the believing yoak-fellow might live in the enjoying and uſe of the unbelieving yoak-fellow? he reſolves them in the affirmative, ſaying, The unbeleeving huſband is ſanctifyed</hi> in (<hi>as 'tis in the</hi> Greek) <hi>or</hi> to (<hi>not</hi> for <hi>or</hi> by) <hi>the wife, &amp;c.

               <speaker>V.</speaker>
               <p>But here is certainly ſome ſpeciall priviledge ſet forth to the Children of believers accruing to them from the believing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. Beſides, it had been no news to tell them they might have the lawfull uſe of one another, and that their Children were le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45475:11"/> and no baſtards. For where both husband and wiefe were unbeleevers, no man ever doubted but their enjoyment of one another was lawfull, and their iſſue legitimate.</p>

               <p>To which he replyed, Nor <hi>Alexander</hi> ever ſaw ſuch a knot, as the Gordian, which made him cut it, when he could not untie it; you teach me by experience to know that there is no diſputing againſt them that deny all Principles; as where you think the people do not underſtand, you make no ſcruple to deny clear truths in Logick, and Divinitie; Therefore I ſee I muſt go to plain ſcriptures, that all the people may underſtand the abſurdities. Now that the Definition of Baptiſm (which was the thing denyed) belongs to Infants, I prove thus.</p>
               <p>If God inſtitute Baptiſm for infants, Chriſt merited it for them, and they ſtand in need of it, then to infants belongs the Definition of Baptiſm; But God inſtituted, Chriſt merited, and infants ſtand in need of Baptiſm; Therefore to infants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs the Definition of Baptiſm.</p>

               <p>Which he promiſed to prove in order, Firſt that God did inſtitute Baptiſm for infants. He that appointed infants Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members under the Goſpell, did inſtitute Baptiſm for them; But God appointed Infants Church-members under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell; Therefore God did inſtitute Baptiſm for infants.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>He confeſſed it, for infants under the Law were Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members, and yet not Baptized, but Circumciſed, and before the Law Church-members, and yet neither Circumciſed, nor Baptized; but under the Goſpell they were ſo convertible, that all that were Baptized, were Church-members, and all that were Church-members were to be Baptized, which is that which he affirmed now, and is a truth ſo clear, that Maſter <hi>Tombs</hi> confeſſes it all along in his Books, and upon that confeſſed

               <p>He would have denyed it, till a Gentleman told him, that he heard him affirm the ſame in his Sermon the day before, Then he denyed the minor, that God did inſtitute infants Church-members un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpell.</p>

               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>That I'l confirm (ſays he) with a three-fold cord, which will not eaſily be broken, before the Law, under the Law, under the Goſpell, which he framed into an Argument thus, Thoſe whom God did promiſe before the Law, foretell under the Law, actually receive into covenant under the Goſpell, thoſe God did appoint Church-members under the Goſpell; But God did promiſe before the Law, foretell under the Law, and actually receive Infants into Covenant under the Goſpell; Therefore God did appoint Infants Church-members under the Goſpell.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>He denyed the Minor, That God did not promiſe before the Law, foretell under the Law, and actually receive infants into co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant under the Goſpell.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Which was proved in order, firſt that God did promiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law that infants ſhould be in covenant under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, thus.</p>
               <p>That which God did promiſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> was before the Law; But God did promiſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that infants ſhould be in covenant under the Goſpell; Therefore God did promiſe before the Law, that infants ſhould be in covenant under the Goſpell. The Minor being denyed, he proved out of <hi>Gen. 17. 7. I will eſtabliſh my covenant between me, and thee, and thy ſeed after thee, in their generations for an everlaſting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and unto thy ſeed after thee.</hi> Thus framing his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; He that makes an everlaſting covenant to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his ſeed after him in their generations, promiſed that infants ſhould be in covenant under the Goſpell; but God makes an everlaſting Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his ſeed after him in their generations: Therefore God promiſed that infants ſhould be in covenant under the Goſpell.</p>

               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>He denyed the Major, ſaying, that everlaſting ſignifyed onely a long time, not that it ſhould be ſo under the Goſpell to the worlds end; and was to be interpreted by the verſe following, I will give unto thee the Land of</hi> Canaan <hi>for an everlaſting poſſeſſion, and yet the</hi> Jews <hi>are now diſpoſſeſſed of</hi> Canaan.</p>

               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>They are now diſpoſſeſt, but ſhall be poſſeſſed of it again at their converſion, and ſo have an everlaſting poſſeſſion, in the type to the end of the world, in the Antitype for ever, but that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45475:15"/> the covenant that God made with <hi>Abraham</hi> is to continue to the end of the World appears, in that it is a Goſpell-covenant; That which is a Goſpell-covenant is to continue to the end of the world; But the covenant that God made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed to all generations, is a Goſpell covenant, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 8. and the ſcripture foreſeeing that God would Juſtifie the Heathen, through faith, preached the Goſpell before to <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſaying, <hi>In thee ſhall nations be bleſſed;</hi> Therefore it is to continue to the end of the world.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>Without repeating, he confuſedly anſwer'd thus, that it was an everlasting covenant, and to continue to the end of the world, but not to infants.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>He told him firſt that it was a denying of the Concluſion, then took away his anſwer thus; If God command infants to ſtand before him in covenant, then it is to continue to infants; But God commands infants to ſtand in covenant before him; Therefore it is to continue to infants. <hi>Deut, 29. 10, 11. Ye ſtand this day all of you before the Lord, your God, your captains of your tribes, your elders, and your officers, with all the men of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>your little ones.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>He ſaid that he ſhould have proved that it ſhould continue to infants to the worlds end, for he did not deny but that infants in ſome ſenſe were in covenant under the Law, but not under the Goſpell.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Yes under the Goſpell; If Chriſt hath obtained a more excellent Miniſterie, and is a Mediator of a better covenant, which is eſtabliſhed upon better promiſes, then if infants were in covenant under the Law, they are in covenant under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell; But <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 6. Chriſt hath obtained a more excellent Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, was a Mediator of a better covenant, which was eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed upon better promiſes; Therefore if infants were in covenant under the Law, they are in covenant under the Goſpell.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>He denyed the conſequence of the Major, that though the covenant of the Goſpell was a better covenant than that of the Law, yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants were not in covenant as well under the Goſpell, as under the Law.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Which was thus taken away; That which unchurches the one half of Chriſtendome, and leaves them no ordinary means of Salvation, cannot be a better covenant; But to deny in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants to be in covenant, unchurches the one half of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and leaves them no ordinary means of Salvation: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it cannot be a better covenant.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Without repeating the Syllogiſm, or denying either of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:45475:15"/> or formally applying any diſtinction, he ſaid, the covenant under the Goſpell was made onely with the ſpirituall ſeed of</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Which was thus diſproved; If the covenant was made in the ſame manner, and extent, to the Gentiles, as to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> then under the Goſpell it was not onely made to the Spirituall ſeed; But it was made in the ſame manner, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to the Gentiles, as it was to the <hi>Jewes;</hi> Therefore under the Goſpell it was not onely made to the Spirituall ſeed.</p>

               <p>Which was proved by this Enthymema: The partition wall is pulled down, and <hi>Jew</hi> and Gentile are all one in Chriſt Jeſus; Therefore the covenant is made in the ſame manner and extent, to the <hi>Jew,</hi> and Gentile.</p>
            </sp>

                  <hi>He denyed the conſequent, that, though the partition wall was taken down, and both</hi> Jew <hi>and Gentile are all one in Chriſt Jeſus, ſeeing the Goſpell was offered to all nations; Yet under the Goſpell the covenant was onely with the Elect, and believers.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Which was proved thus; That which is made to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God upon earth, is not onely made to the Elect; But that which is made to the whole Church viſible is made to the kingdom of God upon Earth; Therefore it was not onely made to the Elect.</p>

               <p>He denyed the Major, that, that which was made to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God upon earth, is not onely made to the Elect.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Which was proved thus; In the kingdom of God, that is in the Church Militant, there are not onely Elect, but repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, Saints, but hypocrites, for all that are outwardly called, are of the kingdom of God in this ſenſe, and many are called, but few choſen, The kingdom of God is compared to a field, where there are tares, as well as wheat; a fold, where there are goats as well as ſheep, to a noble mans houſe, where there are veſſels of diſhonour, as well as honour; And if the Church in regard of outward adminiſtration of ordinances (which is the Queſtion) were onely the Elect, then it would follow that there were no viſible Church upon earth, the <hi>Jews</hi> had no more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45475:16"/> Church than the heathens, the diſtinction of the Church viſible, and inviſible were frivolous, for no man, nor angell, knows who are Elect, nor any but God.</p>
               <p>To which iſſue the firſt branch of the Argument being brought, Mr. <hi>C.</hi> referred the judgement of it to the people, And proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ſecond, that God foretold under the Law, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants ſhould be Church-members under the Goſpell.</p>

Whence he framed this Argument. He that foretold that he would lift up his hand to the Gentiles, and ſet up a ſtandard to the people, and that they ſhould bring their ſons in their Armes, and their daughters ſhall be carryed upon their Shoulders, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told that infants ſhould be Church-members under the Goſpell; But thus ſaith the Lord God, <hi>Behold I will lift up my h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                  <hi>verſes</hi> of this Chapter confutes it, intimating that the <hi>Jewes</hi> after Chriſts coming ſhall loſe their own naturall, and the Gentiles Children ſhall be adopted, and engrafted into their place; They, that is the Gentiles conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſhall bring thy ſons, thine by a kind of adoption, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall ſucceſſion, for the Gentiles Children were ingrafted into the ſtock of the <hi>Jewes</hi> Children broke off; And this is ſo clear from the Context (compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.)

               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>He replyed, that he would grant him that it was more than a Metaphoricall ſpeech, (for a Metaphor conſiſted but in one ſingle trope) but it was a continuation of ſeverall tropes, and therefore Allegoricall; yet it does not follow, that nothing could be gathered from it, for then nothing could be gathered from any Parable in the Goſpell; Nay nor any part of the New Teſtament; for there is ſcarce a ſentence without ſomes Tropes in it.</p>

               <p>Which Mr. <hi>C.</hi> took thus away; Them that they ſhould bring in their boſomes were Infants; But it was foretold that they ſhould bring them in their boſoms; Therefore they were Infants.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Then Mr.</hi> Tombs <hi>ſaid it was an analogie, and performed when the Gentiles perſwaded their Children to embrace Chriſt.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>Well then, it is their Children, not thy children, <hi>oportet eſſe memorem;</hi> But not that neither; for that Scripture which in the letter ſuits with many other Scriptures, but in the pretended analogie with no other, cannot be the meaning; But to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret it literally of bringing Children to Chriſt in the boſome, ſuits with many ſcriptures, and to perſwade them to come to Chriſt, with no ſcriptures; Therefore it can not be the meaning.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> T. <hi>could not name one text of ſcripture, where to bring in armes, or boſome, was to perſwade to come to Chriſt.</hi>

               <p>Not ſo; for nothing of it makes againſt me, but that an

The Arguments I raiſe hence are two, the firſt is this, There ſhall be no more an Infant of dayes, that is, Infants ſhall not be uncapable of the ſeal, while their age is meaſured by dayes, as the <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ws</hi> Infants that might not be Circumciſed till a week had paſſed over them; Therefore Infants new born are capable of the ſeal; The ſecond Argument is this, The child ſhall dye an hundred year old, that is, as an hundred year old, or as well a Church-member as if he were a hundred year old; Therefore Children may be Baptized under the Goſpell.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> T. <hi>found fault with that interpretation, ſhall dye an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years old,</hi> that <hi>is as if an hundred years old.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>He anſwered, to take it literally would imply a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, for it was impoſſible to be a child, and a hundred years old, and was better than his, and the Anabaptiſts expoſition of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they were <hi>Baptized under the Cloud,</hi> that is (ſay you) as if they were Baptized under the cloud, when nothing hindred, out they were really Baptized under the cloud.

               <p>To which was replyed; Mr. <hi>T.</hi> will ſtill be wiſer than the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and read the Contents of the Chapter; The calling of the Gentiles <hi>v.</hi> 1. the <hi>Jews</hi> rejected 17. the bleſſed ſtate of the new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to the end.</p>

               <p>To which was replyed; what is this to an Infant of dayes, or a child dying a hundred years old? when it is apparent both from the Contents, and Texts that this of <hi>Zachary</hi> is meant of the <hi>Jews</hi> return from Captivity, and more apparent that that of <hi>Eſ.</hi> is meant of the ſtate of Chriſts kingdome under the Goſpell, which I prove thus; That Interpretation that brings with it abſurditie, untruth, blaſphemie, is not to be admitted; But to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nterpret it of the <hi>Jews</hi> return from Captivitie brings with it ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurditie,

               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Which was proved in order; firſt that it brought with it abſurdity, To apply the 25. <hi>verſe</hi> to the return from Captivity was abſurd, that the wolf and the lamb ſhould feed together, and the Lion ſhould eat ſtraw with the bullock, and duſt ſhould be the ſerpents meat; Therefore it brought with it abſurdity. Secondly that it brought with it untruth; But to apply the 19. <hi>v.</hi> to the return from Captivity brought with it an untruth, that the voice of weeping ſhould be no more heard in <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> for it was twice deſtroyed after, once by <hi>Antiochus,</hi> then by <hi>Veſpatian,</hi> and <hi>Titus;</hi> Therefore it brought with it an untruth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly that it brought with it blaſphemie; for to interpret the 17. <hi>verſe,</hi> (Behold I create new heavens, and new earth, and the former ſhall no more be remembred, and come into mind) of the ſecond temple, is blaſphemous; Therefore it brought with it blaſphemie, for it croſſeth St. <hi>Peters</hi> interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 13. We according to his promiſe look for new hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and a new earth; For can any rationall man think, that the new temple built at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in <hi>Cyrus</hi> his time, was this new heaven, and new earth, that the former ſhould be no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred? When the antient men are ſaid to weep, becauſe the glory of the latter temple was ſhort of the glory of the firſt, <hi>Ezra</hi> 3. 12. [It was inferiour to <hi>Solomons</hi> temple, firſt in reſpect of the building, that was lower, and meaner; ſecondly, in reſpect of the veſſels, before of Gold, now of Braſs; thirdly of five things that were loſt, firſt the Ark of God, ſecondly, the <hi>Urim<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Then</hi> C.

               <p>He told him an exploſion, not for diſability (for his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute was plauſible inough) but that he would neither be ſatisfied with Dr. <hi>Salvage</hi> his anſwer, nor the Doctor of the Chairs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination; but fell to repetitions, and extravagances, as now.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> launched into a tedious diſcourſe to vindicate himſelf till he had tyred the Auditors, who cryed out this is but to waſte time; And a learned Gentleman ſpake aloud, this is but to ſpend the time in parling, that he may avoid the gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot, for he is affraid the great thunderbold is behind: and ſo with much adoe, he was brought to diſpute again, where Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>C.</hi> falling upon the third branch of his Argument, That God did actually receive Infants to be Church-members under the Goſpell, began thus.</p>

               <p>Thoſe whom Chriſt commanded his diſciples to Baptize, they may be Baptized; But Chriſt commanded his Diſciples to Baptize infants; Therefore they may be Baptized. The Minor being denyed, was proved thus; He that commanded his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to baptize all Nations, commanded them to baptize in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants; But Chriſt commanded his Diſciples; <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. to baptize all Nations; Therefore Chriſt commanded them to baptize infants.</p>

               <p>He replyed; that Circumciſion was principally meant, and the doctrine of <hi>Moſes</hi> onely as an Appendix of it, and children were as capable of the doctrine then, as they were in <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> his time, when all in the moment of Circumciſion were tyed to the obſervation of the doctrine, though they of ripe years (to uſe <hi>Voſſius</hi> his diſtinction) were taught the doctrine <hi>antecedenter,</hi> before Circumciſion, infants of eight days <hi>conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenter,</hi> after Circumciſion, when age made them capable; I know (ſayes God) <hi>Abraham</hi> will teach his Children; So it is apparent all thoſe upon whom Circumciſion with the doctrine of <hi>Moſes</hi> was to be impoſed, were called Diſciples; But ſome of theſe were Infants, for onely Infants were Circumciſed among the Jews, and Infants with the Parents among the Gentiles; therefore ſome infants are Diſciples.</p>

               <p>The ſecond circumſtance in the text, is the ſubſtantive verb, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

               <p>The third circumſtance in the text is the <hi>finis cui,</hi> the end to whom the promiſe is, to you, and your Children; the Jews Children under the Law were in Covenant with their Parents, the Charter is confirm'd under the Goſpel to them and their Children. The Jews when they crucified Chriſt, called for a Curſe upon themſelves, and upon their Children, here the Apoſtle gives them a Remedy as large as the Diſeaſe, <hi>the promiſe</hi> (that is, of Freedome from the curſe) <hi>is to you and your Children.</hi>

               <p>Yes, and before they actually believe, which I prove thus: The bleſſing is as large as the curſe; But the curſe extended even to children, before they could actually believe (<hi>his blood be upon us and upon our children</hi>) Therefore the bleſſing.</p>

               <p>Well, you diſcover of what ſpirit you are, and your ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance; Are not theſe the words of the learned aſſembly of Divines in the Directory confirmed by Ordinance of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>T.</speaker>
               <p>That is not meant of a Covenant-holyneſs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, its as cleer as the light, and ſo you your ſelf interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it at <hi>Roſs,</hi> as there are hundreds that will witneſs, which was upon this occaſion. I preſſed that if the immediat parents were holy, the children were holy with a Covenant holineſs; you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed the inference, and ſaid the meaning of it was, that <hi>Abraham</hi> the father of the faithfull was the firſt fruits, and root that was holy, and therefore his poſterity was holy, and in covenant [And in this expoſition, as he agreed with truth, ſo with <hi>Beza.</hi> who ſays that children are holy, that is comprehended in covenant from the womb, and with <hi>Bowles</hi> who ſaith, that they are holy with outward holineſs, by which they are judged to be in covenant.]</p>
               <p>But to return from whence, by your retortion, we have digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. I am to prove that holyneſs is never taken in Scripture for Matrimoniall cleaneſs in oppoſition to Illegitimation. Not in that place <hi>Ezra</hi> 9. 2. the holy ſeed have mingled themſelves with the ſeed of thoſe lands; which is either your onely, or principall hold, (as far as I can gather out of your books) therefore in no place.</p>

               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Which was proved thus. If it be meant of Matrimoniall cleanneſs, then this muſt be the meaning of the words; The holy ſeed, that is the lawfully begotten Jews, have mingled themſelves with the ſeed of thoſe lands, that is the baſtards of thoſe lands; But that cannot be the meaning, for happily there were ſome Baſtards among the Jews, and in that ſenſe not holy, and no Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtards among the Nations, but all, or the moſt Legitimate, and therefore in that ſenſe not unholy; Therefore it is not meant of Matrimoniall holineſs.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe two verſes hold out the rich Charter of the Goſpel, which our Saviour delivered to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles after his Reſurrection; The parts are two, Firſt a Precept, in the former verſe, <hi>Go ye into all the world, and Preach the Goſpel to every Creature;</hi> Secondly a Promiſe, with a Commination in the latter. <hi>He that beleeveth, and is Baptized, ſhall be ſaved; but he that beleeveth not, ſhall be damned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Precept, we have two particulars, Firſt a Miſſion, he ſends them, <hi>Go ye into all the world;</hi> Secondly a Commiſſion, he authorizes them, <hi>and Preach the Goſpel to every Creature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the latter verſe, or promiſe, we have Firſt the thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, layd down affirmatively, <hi>ſhall be ſaved;</hi> Secondly the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification, and that either abſolute, <hi>he that beleeveth,</hi> or conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, <hi>and is Baptized; he that beleeveth, and is Baptized, ſhall be ſaved;</hi> Or a Commination <hi>ſhall be damned,</hi> with a qualification negative, and abſolutely without any limitation, <hi>he that beleeveth not ſhall be damned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We'l only hint at the former verſe for introduction to the latter <hi>And he ſaid,</hi> (that is Chriſt,) Obſerve, that it is only God, Chriſt God and Man, that can give Miſſion, or Commiſſion to Preach,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:45475:26"/> and ordain Sacraments. <hi>Matth. 28. 18. All power is given me in Heaven and Earth, Go ye therefore, and teach all Nations.</hi> Go ye into all the world, there is the largeneſs of their Commiſſion, to all the world, as he, to all Nations as <hi>Matthew.</hi> Hence obſerve, the Apoſtles, and by them the Evangeliſts had an extraordinary Commiſſion, which extended through the world, but our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion ordinarily is limited to certain places; True it is, there may be itinerants upon ſpeciall occaſions, (and they alſo confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned within their verges,) But as Doctor <hi>Buckeridge</hi> obſerves well when Chriſt ſpeaks to Apoſtles, he ſays, <hi>Go ye into all the world,</hi> but when to ordinary Paſtors, and Teachers <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> he fixed ſome to be Paſtors, and ſome Teachers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And Preach the Goſpel to every Creature,</hi> there is the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, wherein we have Firſt the Act <hi>Preach,</hi> that is proclaime, Secondly the object of the Goſpel, which in the Originall, and other languages ſignifies good news, or a good ſpeech; from the connexion between the Miſſion and Commiſſion coming from the ſame Authour Chriſt, and extended to the ſame perſons, the Apoſtles, and their ſucceſſours, obſerve, that none may Preach as Church-Officers, but they that are ſent in a Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; our adverſary in the common cauſe ſpoke ſo home to this, that we need not preſs it further. The laſt thing is the extent of the Commiſſion, and that a very large one, <hi>unto every Creature,</hi> as here, to all Nations, as <hi>Matthew.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Quaere</hi> will be, what is meant by every Creature? Some limit it to every rational creature, Angels, men, Devils, as <hi>Origen,</hi> and his <hi>miſericordes Doctores</hi> who held the Devils and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates ſhould be ſaved; but that cannot be; for 2 <hi>Pet. 2. 4. They are caſt down to hell, and reſerved to judgement.</hi> Some more ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſtrain it onely to man, and that when he is come to age, and underſtanding, excluding Children; this is too ſtrict, True it is, Infants are not capable to be taught of men, but they may be taught of God; they cannot actually underſtand the Goſpel, but they may actually receive the benefit of the Goſpel; a noble mans Child hath intereſt in his Fathers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Hence obſerve, that every creature in a ſenſe is ſenſible of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit they have by Chriſt; but every one in their kind: men come to years, and diſcretion are capable of actual underſtanding, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual profeſſion, actual faith; Infants onely in <hi>actu primo,</hi> are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the firſt ſeeds of underſtanding, of profeſſion, of Faith, which will ſhew it ſelf in the fruits when they come to years; The reſt of our fellow-creatures as by a natural inſtinct they groan for the curſe, ſo by an other inſtinct, they lift up their heads in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the bleſſing, and that <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

            <p>Firſt, Baptiſm in the Original, ſignifies nothing but a waſhing, as <hi>Pareus</hi> upon the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſays, <hi>Baptiſmus Graecis est quaevis ablutio,</hi> Baptiſm is in Greek any waſhing, whether by dipping, or ſprinkling; to Baptize is to dip, or ſprinkle ſays, <hi>Ravenel</hi> ſo ſays the Churches old Catechiſm, dipped, or ſprinkled in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt; ſo the Directory, Baptize the child, by pouring, or ſprinkling of the water on the face of the child, without adding any further ceremony. And as many kinds there are of waſhing, ſo many there are of Baptizing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Pillars of the Greek Tongue, <hi>Heſyehius, Budeus, Stepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>Many places of Scripture confirm this, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 2. there the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were Baptized in the red Sea, when their feet did but touch the water, not as if they were Baptized, when they were not (as the Ana-baptiſts gloſs upon this place) and that the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi> were really Baptized, for the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were not Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in their ſenſe, but ſunk to the bottom like ſtones. <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. 5.</p>
            <p>Baptized under the Cloud, not that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> as if they were (as they deſcant) under the Cloud, for the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were never under the Cloud, for the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> went before the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> and the Cloud, part of it was over the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> part of it went before them.</p>
            <p>There is mention made in the Goſpel of Baptizing, or waſhing of themſelves when they came from Market, of Cups, of Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, of Tables, which cannot be meant of plunging<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in water ſo often, where that Element was ſo ſcarce, but rincing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John</hi>'s Baptizing in <hi>Jordan, Philip</hi>'s going down to the River with the <hi>Eunuch</hi> proves nothing at all; for what ſtrange conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence would this be, eſpecially from the Anabaptiſts (that muſt have expreſs Scripture for all things) <hi>John</hi> Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in <hi>Jordan, Philip</hi> went down into the water<note place="margin">

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:45475:28"/> of water upon them, for any thing that appears out of the Text.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object. John</hi> Baptized in <hi>Enon,</hi> becauſe there was much water.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This will ſeem to be no wonder in thoſe hot Countries, where there are many miles without a Spring of water, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeeing Geographers, and Travellers tells us, that <hi>Enon</hi> is a little Brook that one may ſtride over, ſcarce Knee deep, and therefore not capable of dipping.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But Baptiſm, ſay they, muſt reſemble the death of Chriſt, <hi>Rom. 6. 4. We are buryed with him by Baptiſm,</hi> which is not by ſprinkling, but dipping.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, the ſcope of the place is to ſhew, that one end of our Baptiſm is to Seal our Communion with Chriſt in his death, but to preſs a neceſſity of reſemblance by deſcending into the water, and coming out again, we ſee no ground in Text, and if our abiding under the water muſt anſwer Chriſts Burial in exact repreſentation, then as Chriſt lay three days, and three nights in the Grave, ſo they muſt lye three days, and three nights under the water, which if it were put in execution, the diſpute would quickly be at an end.</p>
            <p>But ſhould we grant this reſemblance, I appeal to any man, whether our pouring on of water in Baptiſm, does not more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble our Chriſtian Burial, which is by pouring on of Earth, or Duſt, than by plunging over head.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee it proved, that Baptizing is any kind of waſhing, <hi>In the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt;</hi> we do not deny with Maſter <hi>Perkins,</hi> that if we were to Baptize converted Turks, or Pagans of ripe age, in hot Countries, we might Baptize them by dipping, Provided that their Garments were not firſt Baptized, or waſhed, for that is conceived to be no leſs ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than Beptizing of Bells; Baptiſm (ſays <hi>Voſſius) non est immerſio veſtium, ſed humani Corporis,</hi> is not a waſhing of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but of the Body; we account the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, for preſenting that worſhip, Firſt to the Image, which is terminated in Chriſt; the Garments are firſt waſhed, or dipped, and the Body but at the moſt wet, or moyſtned through them.</p>
            <p>But to affirm that no Baptiſm but that which is by dipping is lawful, is a will-worſhip, much more, that Baptiſm otherwiſe is a nullitie, and thoſe that are Baptized ſo, ought to be Baptized
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:45475:29"/> again, or Re-Baptized, which the Senate of <hi>Syrick</hi> underſtood well, when they made an Act, that all that did preſume to Re-Baptize ſuch as were Baptized before, ſhould be drowned.</p>
            <p>So we have reſolved the former doubt, that Baptizing is not dipping, and come to the latter, that Infants may, nay ought to be Baptized. And (Brethren) I beſeech you to give me leave a little to ſpeak for Infants, thoſe poor Souls, that cannot ſpeak for themſelves.</p>
            <p>And before we come to the Queſtion, take with you theſe two Conſiderations; Firſt, that thoſe truths that were not in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie in the Primitive times, the Apoſtles were not ſo pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual in preſſing of them, ſeeing there was no need; <hi>Solon</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing asked why he made no Law againſt murtherers of Parents, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, becauſe he conceiv'd none would commit that unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Act; If the Apoſtles had been asked, why they did not put down Infant-Baptiſm in plainer terms, I ſuppoſe they would have anſwered, that they thought none would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed it.</p>
            <p>Secondly obſerve, that thoſe things that are preſſed often in the old Teſtament, are mentioned more ſparingly in the New, as the Sabbath, and Magiſtracy in the old Teſtament, line upon line, and precept upon precept, but ſcarce a Syllable for a Chriſtian Sabbath, or a Chriſtian Magiſtracie in the new. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more clear then Infants Church-Memberſhip in the old Teſtament, therefore not ſo clear in the New, and yet clear enough to thoſe that have eyes to ſee it, as will appear by theſe reaſons following.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Arg.</hi> Firſt, thoſe that are in Covenant with God, ought to have the Seal of the Covenant, which is Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>But Infants of beleeving Parents are in Covenant with God.</p>
            <p>Therefore Infants ought to have the Seal of the Covenant, which is Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>The former Propoſition is firm by Confeſſion of all Divines, even our adverſaries, <hi>Haec eſt fundamentalis ratio paedobaptiſmi</hi> (ſayes <hi>Daneus</hi>) this is the fundamentall reaſon of Baptizing of Infants, that they are in Covenant, <hi>Eſſe foederatum ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit ad accipiendum ſignum foederis,</hi> ſayes <hi>Davenant,</hi> to be in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is ſufficient to receive the ſign, and ſeal of the Covenant, <hi>Omnes foederati ſunt Baptizandi,</hi> ſays <hi>Wendel,</hi> all that are in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant are to be Baptized, <hi>Si in foedere ſunt, impiè agunt, qui eis ſignum foederis negant,</hi> ſaith <hi>Ferus,</hi> if they be in Covenant, they
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:45475:29"/> do wickedly that deny them the ſign of the Covenant; in a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill contract (ſays Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi>) the Father, and the heir make but one perſon, and the Covenant's for himſelf and his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>The Minor propoſition that Infants of believing Parents are in Covenant, is grounded on many Scriptures, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 17. 7. Where God eſtabliſhes a Covenant, not onely with <hi>Abraham,</hi> but with his ſeed after him in their generations, for an everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, everlaſting, and therefore to laſt to the end of the World, as <hi>Cornelius à Lapide</hi> ſayes, <hi>abſolutè aeternum eſt in ſemine ſpirituali fidelibus,</hi> It is abſolutely everlaſting in the ſpirituall ſeed to the faithfull. <hi>Galat.</hi> 3. 8. The Scripture foreſeeing that God would juſtifie the Heathen through faith, preached before the Goſpel to <hi>Abraham;</hi> therefore if <hi>Iſaac</hi> was in Covenant with his Father when he was but eight days old, and had the ſeal by vertue of the Lamb to be ſlain, much more the Children of believing Parents, by vertue of the Lamb that is already ſlain <hi>Deuter.</hi> 29. 11. When all the people ſtood in Covenant before the Lord, their little ones are mentioned amongſt the reſt, which is further confirmed, <hi>Acts 2. 38, 39. Be Baptized every one of you, for the promiſe is to you, and your Children;</hi> to ſay that they were not yet believers, is but a ſhift, the Text makes it cleer, as ſoon as they were believers, their Children were in Covenant with them, and to be Baptized.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 2 Such as were Circumciſed vnder the Law, may be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized under the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>But Infants of beleevers were Circumciſed under the Law. Therefore they may be baptized under the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Huic Argumento non omnes Anabaptiſtae reſistent</hi> (ſayes learned <hi>Whitaker</hi>) all the Anabaptiſts ſhall not be able to reſiſt this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument; the Minor, that Infants under the Law were Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, is confeſſed.</p>
            <p>The former propoſition is onely queſtioned, that Baptiſm un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel to Infants, does not neceſſarily follow from Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion under the Law; <hi>Auguſtin</hi> is cleer for it, ſaying, <hi>Muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis ſignis manet eadem gratia ſine aetatis diſcrimine,</hi> the outward vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſignes being changed, the ſame grace remaines without any difference of age, and he gives a reaſon, becauſe the grace of God is not ſtraiter in the new Teſtament than in the old; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 8. 6. Is ſaid to be Mediator of a better Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, but how were it a better Covenant, if all poor Infants that were in Covenant under the Law, were out of Covenant under
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:45475:30"/> the Goſpel? <hi>Titus 2. 12. The grace of God hath appeared unto all,</hi> and therefore ſurely to Infants; as <hi>Irenaeus ſayes, Christus pro parvulis parvulus factus eſt,</hi> Chriſt became a little one, for little ones ſake, that he might redeem the little ones. Little ones were the firſt Martyrs that ſuffered for Chriſt, <hi>in Rama was a voice heard;</hi> and that Baptiſm came in place of Circumciſion, the Apoſtle clears it, <hi>Coloſſ. 2. 11. 12. Ye are Circumciſed with Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion made without hands;</hi> How is that? <hi>Buryed with him in Baptiſm.</hi> Hence ariſes another Argument.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. Thoſe that were once in Covenant, had the Seal of the Covenant, and were never disfranchized, and put out of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, have title to the Covenant, and Seal of it ſtill.</p>
            <p>But Infants were once in Covenant, had the Seal of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and were never disfranchized, and put out of Covenant. Therefore Infants have title to the covenant, and ſeal of it ſtill.</p>
            <p>Let any man ſhew one ſillable, one tittle in Scripture, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Infants were put out, and we'l yield the gantlet; nay, the Goſpell is ſo far from expreſſing of them that they are put out, that it gives them large commendations beyond them of riper years, making them the rule of our perfection, <hi>as new born babes, receive the ſincere milk of the Word. Unleſs you be as little Children, ye ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of God;</hi> which is a caſe ſo cleer, that even <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelf includes, <hi>Nullum eſt impedimentum, &amp;c.</hi> there is nothing that hinders, but that Infants may as well be Baptized under the Goſpell, as they were Circumciſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law; for neither hath God forbidden Miniſters to give them the Sacrament, neither are they uncapable to receive it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. That which God hath commanded may lawfully be practiſed by the Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But God hath commanded Infant-Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>Therefore it may be lawfully practiſed by the Miniſters of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. That God hath commanded it, appears, <hi>Matth. 28. 19. Go Baptize all Nations;</hi> its a generall command and (as <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſayes) <hi>poſito generali mandato pars ejus negari non potest,</hi> a generall command being given, no part of it can be denyed; Infants are a part of Nations, and included in them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But here is no mention made of Infants.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>AnſW.</hi> No nor of them of age; we might retort it upon our adverſaries, there is no mention made of <hi>Dippers,</hi> no, nor of them that are to be dipped, therefore they ought not to dip, nor be
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:45475:30"/> dipped: Generals include particulars in all Lawes; <hi>Pſalm. 117. Praiſe the Lord all ye Nations,</hi> Nations includes old men and babes, young men and maids all without exception, as another Pſalm interprets it.</p>
            <p>Now if Infants be excepted, contrary to that ſaying of Saint <hi>Ambroſe, Qui dixit omnes nullum excepit, ne<expan>
                     <am>

If (I ſay) they be excepted, its either becauſe they are not named, or becauſe we never read in Scripture that any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants were Baptized, or, becauſe they are not capable; (that fourth cavill being the ſame with the third, I'le take away anon) but for none of theſe three; therefore Infants are not excepted from Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>Not for the firſt, becauſe they are not named, for ſo neither old men, nor nobles, nor Miniſters are named. Not becauſe we read not of their Baptiſm, ſo we neither read of the Baptiſm of the Apoſtles, nor of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> yet we piouſly believe that they were Baptized; <hi>De negatione facti ad jus non valet conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> ſuch a thing is not mentioned, that it was done; therefore it was not done, or was not done therefore it ought not to have been done, is no conſequence; Chriſt did, and ſaid many things that are not written; ſo did his Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>Not for the third, becauſe they are uncapable, which is deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for if Infants be uncapable, it is either becauſe they have not repentance and faith in act, which cannot hinder them; Chriſt was Baptized, had not repentance, for he had no ſin to repent of, had not faith, for faith preſuppoſeth one loſt in himſelf, that depends upon another for ſalvation; Chriſt is that Rock of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, upon whom all mankind being loſt depends; Neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot hear the word preached; then they that are born deaf ſhould be excluded from Baptiſm; or becauſe they are not otherwiſe qualified; but that cannot hinder them, for God requires no more of them that are in covenant, and born, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving parents, but a pure capacity, and receptability, which Divines call <hi>Potentiam objectivam;</hi> as God in the beginning created the World of nothing, ſo in the beginning of the new creature he does regenerate and recreate us of nothing, upon this account it is, that we read of many whole families Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed not excluding, but rather including<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Infants, <hi>Cornelius</hi> was Baptized with his houſhold, <hi>Acts 10. 47 48.

            <p>Well then, doth Chriſt take Children in his armes, and would he have them all put out of his viſible Church? would he have us receive them in his Name, and yet not to receive them into his viſible Church, nor as his Diſciples? How can Infants be received in Chriſts Name, if they belong not viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to him, and his Church? Nay, doth Chriſt account it a receiving of himſelf, and ſhall we then refuſe to receive them, or acknowledge them the ſubjects of his viſible Kingdom? will it not follow then that whoſoever refuſeth them, refuſeth Chriſt, and him that ſent him?

            <pb n="44" facs="tcp:45475:32"/>
            <p>But Infants of believing parents are Diſciples.</p>
            <p>Therefore ſome Infants may be Baptized.</p>
            <p>The Major, or former propoſition, is granted by our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, who tranſlate that place, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                  </gap>each all Nations,</hi> confeſſing, as ſoon as they are Diſciples they may be Baptized</p>
            <p>Now for the Minor, that Infants are Diſciples, is evident from <hi>Acts 15. 10. Why, tempt yee God, and put a yoak upon the neck of the Diſciples?</hi> this yoak was Circumciſion, and the attendants of it, as will appear by comparing it with the fift verſe, and the context from the beginning of the Chapter. Now among the Jews, children were onely to be Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and amongſt the Gentiles, children together with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents when they were converted, and became Proſelites. To ſay that not onely Circumciſion, but the Doctrine, and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the whole Law, by the yoak is meant, is but a ſhift; Circumciſion was the Seal, or Ordinance by which the Jews were bound to obſerve the Doctrine, and the Law, and all thoſe upon whom the yoak was layd by Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are called Diſciples; whereof Infants were a great part.</p>
            <p>And if it be objected, that children are not capable of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, as it is nothing to the purpoſe, ſo it contradicts Scripture, <hi>Eſay 54. 13. And all thy Children ſhall be taught of the Lord, and great ſhall be the peace of thy Children.</hi> And if any one carnally interpret this of the Jews return from cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, as they do other places of <hi>Eſa.</hi> our Saviour checks them, <hi>John</hi> 6. 45. And <hi>It is written in the Prophets, And they ſhall all be taught of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 7. All that have faith may be Baptized.</p>
            <p>But ſome Infants have faith. Therefore ſome Infants may be Baptized.</p>
            <p>The propoſition none will deny, the Minor may be proved by ſeverall reaſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Chriſt expreſly calls them believers, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. He at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes humility to them, and faith; and commands Elders to imitate them; and that you may ſee they were Infants, <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 36. tells us they were ſuch as Chriſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ook up in his armes.</p>
            <pb n="45" facs="tcp:45475:32"/>
            <p>Secondly; they are ſaid to receive the Kingdom of God, <hi>Mark</hi> 10. that is, the grace of God. Remiſſion of ſins, and life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall; now the Kingdom is not received, but by faith in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, they pleaſe God, therefore Chriſt bleſſeth them; but without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, either faith muſt be allowed them, or ſalvation denyed them; but the latter is cruell, and impious; therefore the former muſt be godly, and pious; faith onely purifies the heart, but no unclean thing ſhall enter into Heaven.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, though Infants cannot make actuall profeſſion of faith, yet they may have inward roots of ſanctification, and faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> and <hi>Jeremie</hi> were ſanctified in their mothers wombs; let carnaliſts ſay what they will, that is the principal meaning of that place, <hi>Eſay 65. 20. There ſhall be no more a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Therefore <hi>Paraeus</hi> ſayes, <hi>Infantes Eccleſiae etiam ante Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum cenſentur fideles;</hi> Infants of the Church, even before Baptiſm, are judged faithfull. <hi>Hommius</hi> ſayes, Infants have faith, <hi>in ſemine,</hi> in the ſeed, though not <hi>in meſſe,</hi> in the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt; <hi>Beza</hi> ſayes, they have faith <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

            <p n="1">1. Active which the Elder have by hearing the Word.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Paſſive, and by imputation, which Infants have by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Covenant, and Divine promiſe. <hi>Pelagius</hi> asks <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> where he places Infants Baptized? he anſwers, <hi>in numero credentium,</hi> in the number of believers, and addes, <hi>nec judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care ullo modo aliter audebis, ſi non vis eſſe apertè haereticus,</hi> neither may thou preſume to judge otherwiſe, if thou wilt not be a plain Heretick. We'l conclude this with that of <hi>Voſſius,</hi> As in naturals, ſo in ſupernaturals we muſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh theſe three things, power, habit, and act; there is the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:45475:33"/> power of reaſoning in Infants, the habit in men ſleeping, but the act, and exerciſe, in them that are waking; the power anſwers the ſeed, the habit the tree, the act, and exerciſe, the fruit; the ſeed of Faith may be in Infants, the habit in men of age, but the act, and exerciſe, in them that work according to the habit.</p>
            <p>8. <hi>Arg.</hi> Thoſe that are Holy, with a Covenant-holineſs, may be Baptized. But Infants of beleeving Parents are Holy with a Covenant-Holineſs. Therefore Infants of beleeving Parents may be Baptized. Eor the former Propoſition, <hi>foederatis compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tit ſignum foederis,</hi> (ſays <hi>Voſſius</hi>) the ſign of the Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to them that are in Covenant; Holineſs is twofold (ſays <hi>Bullinger</hi>) either of Faith, or of the Covenant. <hi>Ezra. 9. 2. Ye have mingled the holy ſeed,</hi> that is them in Covenant, <hi>with the Nations,</hi> that is them that are out of Covenant. Thus you ſee, that Covenant-holineſs is no gibberidge, but grounded upon Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and avouched by learned men: as ſhall more fully appear.</p>
            <p>The Minor, that Children of beleeving Parents are holy with a Covenant-holineſs, is clear from 1. <hi>Cor. 7. 14. Elſe your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were unclean,</hi> that is, not in Covenant, <hi>but now they are holy</hi> that is, in Covenant, thus (beſides the ancients) <hi>Sharpius,</hi> and <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> interpret it, and <hi>Hugo Grotius</hi> himſelf, <hi>Non loqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur Apoſtolus de Sanctitate naturali,</hi> &amp;c. The Apoſtle (ſays he) ſpeaks not of natural holineſs, and inhering to the nature of Children, but of an holineſs adhering to them, that is, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of the Covenant, for the Children of beleevers are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in the Covenant of grace, and therefore accounted holy of God. To interpret it (as the groſs Anabaptiſts do) that they are holy, that is, no Baſtards, is a new holineſs not heard of in Scripture, and as (Doctor <hi>Featly</hi> ſays) a Baſtard expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and <hi>Pareus</hi> gives the reaſon, if the Children of beleevers be therefore holy, becauſe they are no Baſtards, the Children of Pagans are as well holy, for they are alſo no Baſtards. <hi>If the firſt-fruits be holy, the lump is holy, and if the root be holy, ſo are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the branches.</hi> Rom. 11. 16. The firſt fruits and the root, that is the parents; the lump, the branches, that is the Children, and poſterity.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Rom</hi> 11. 17. if the Jews were broken off, and the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles graffed into their place, it will follow, that if the Jews were broken off, Parents with Children, then the Gentiles ſhall be graffed in, Parents with Children.</p>
            <pb n="49" facs="tcp:45475:33"/>
            <p>But the Jews were broken off, Parents with Children. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Gentiles ſhall be graffed in; Parents with Children.</p>
            <p>9. <hi>Arg.</hi> If Infants ſhould be out of Covenant under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, many dangerous abſurdities would follow.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Infants would be loſers by the comming of Chriſt, and be put in a worſe condition than the Jewiſh Infants were; they with the Parents were admitted to the Seal of the Covenant, which was Circumciſion, and not Children with Parents to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if Infants ſhould be in Covenant then, and not now, Grace would be larger under the Law, than under the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, there would be no difference betwixt the Child of a Chriſtian and of a Pagan, but all the Infants of Chriſtians would be as vile as the Children of Turks, Tartars, or Cannibals.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, they would be without God, without Chriſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope in the world; not the Children of God, but of the Devil; would all be damned, for out of Covenant, and viſible Church (ordinarily) there is no ſalvation.</p>
            <p>10. <hi>Arg.</hi> Laſtly, that which hath continued ſince the Apoſtles times with bleſſed ſucceſs, muſt needs be lawful.</p>
            <p>But Infant-Baptiſm hath continued with bleſſed ſucceſs ſince the Apoſtles times.</p>
            <p>Therefore Infant-Baptiſm is lawful.</p>
            <p>We'l begin with the firſt Centurie, or hundred years after Chriſt. <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the Areopagite, whom the Apoſtles converted at <hi>Athens,</hi> ſays, Holy men have received a Tradition from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that is the Apoſtles, to Baptize Infants. <hi>Clemens</hi> (who is recorded by ſome of the antients to ſucceed <hi>Peter</hi> in his Miniſtry at <hi>Rome</hi>) ſays <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Baptzie your Infants.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Irenaeus</hi> (who lived in the ſecond Century) ſays, <hi>Christus pro parvulis parvulus factus eſt,</hi> Chriſt became a little one for little ones ſake, that little ones might be received into Covenant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Origen</hi> that lived in the beginning of the third Century ſays, The Church received a Tradition from the Apoſtles to Baptize Infants, and gives a reaſon, becauſe they are born in impurity of ſin; nay, <hi>Pelagius,</hi> a great Scholar, who lived in the latter end of this Century, though he denyed Original ſin, yet confeſſed Infant-Baptiſm, for when they preſſed him with this Argument, if Infants had not Original ſin, what need they Baptiſm, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that Chriſt appointed, and the Church practiſed Infant-Baptiſm, not to purge ſin by-paſt, but to prevent it for the time to come.</p>
            <pb n="50" facs="tcp:45475:34"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Cyprian</hi> in the fourth Century confirms it in his Epiſtle to <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> and gives an account of a Council of ſixty ſix Biſhops that decreed that Infants ſhould be Baptized. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſays, becauſe every age is lyable to ſin, therefore every age is fit for the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Baptiſm. <hi>Nazianzene</hi> ſays it is better to Seal Infants with Baptiſm, (though they know it not) than to leave them unſealed. <hi>Auſtin</hi> is conceived to go too far, who denyed poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſalvation to them that died un-baptized, preſſing that place <hi>John 3. 5. Except a Man be Born of water, and of the ſpirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Millevitan</hi> Councel in the fifth Century decreed, That whoſoever ſhould deny that Infants, even taken from their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wombs, might not be Baptized, ſhould be accurſed. All Churches, All ages ſince agree in this; the Harmonies of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of all Reformed Churches, the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the Apologie, the old Catechiſm, the twenty ſeventh Article, the Directory, the greater and leſſer Catechiſm compoſed by the Aſſembly of Divines, the late Parliament by a further Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, all confirm it; The Canons of our Church did not only in former times declare, but the Lawes of our Land did puniſh <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> as hereticks. <hi>Mr. Fox</hi> in his <hi>Acts and Monuments</hi> approves of the <hi>Albigenſes, Waldenſes, Wickliffiſts, Lollards,</hi> Poor men of <hi>Lyons, Browniſts, Barrowists,</hi> as members of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches, but wholly excludes the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> as erring fundamentally.</p>
            <p>I'le ſay no more for confirmation of this polemicall diſcourſe, but wind up all with a word of exhortation; I beſeech you, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, conſider what a dangerous errour this is, that robbs the Scripture of its truth, Infants of their right, Parents of their comforts, the Church of its members, Chriſt of his merits, God of his glory? That is the mother of many other errours; hence ſprung the <hi>Ranters, Socinians, Antitrinitarians, Shakers, Level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,</hi> they that are above Ordinances, <hi>Antiſcripturians;</hi> An er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour that God hath expreſſed many ſignall judgments againſt, as <hi>Sleiden</hi> and <hi>Gastius</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and ſome of our worthies in <hi>England</hi> have declared. As reverend <hi>Mr. Cotton</hi> tells one of his Apoſtated flock, that had his houſe burned, and his Children in it, No wonder that fire ſeiſed upon his houſe, and God deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed water to quench it, who denyed that water ſhould be brought to Baptize his Infants.</p>
            <p>Secondly, conſider that much benefit redounds both to Parents, and Children by Infant-Baptiſm.</p>
            <pb n="51" facs="tcp:45475:34"/>
            <p>Firſt, much comfort comes hereby to the Parents, when they conſider Gods free grace to them, and theirs, that <hi>he is not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be called their God, and the God of their ſeed after them. Hebr.</hi> 11. 16.</p>
            <p>Secondly, much benefit comes to Infants by Baptiſm, (which the Devill knowes well, when he cauſes Witches to renounce their Baptiſm, when they enter into Covenant with him) for they are thereby addmitted into the boſome of the Church, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted, and conſecrated unto God, his Name is put upon them, they wear his Royall badge, and by it they are diſtinguiſhed from <hi>Heathens.</hi> And this is ſo clear from Scriptures, truly and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually underſtood, <hi>That the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the God of Peace and Truth, by his Spirit, lead us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all truth, keep us pure, and unſpotted in this houre of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> temptation, and triall, keep us faithfull to the death, that ſo we may receive a crown of life.</p>

                     <p>Still more venome, he calls it a <hi>Libell;</hi> why? becauſe unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed? So is his Plea, and the moſt of his works, except his <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercitation,</hi> and <hi>Examen,</hi> and they but conditionally, which being violated, renders them more obnoxious. Or becauſe diſſonant from the doctrine of the reformed Churches? So this falls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that guilt, and it is cleared. A <hi>Libell</hi> (as my Lord of St. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans</hi> Etimologized it) hath its name from a <hi>Ly,</hi> and a <hi>Bell;</hi> A <hi>Ly</hi> hatched at home, a <hi>Bell</hi> to ring it abroad; So Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> his <hi>Plea for Anti-Paedobaptiſts</hi> was hatched in private in his ſtudy, rung abroad through the Country; A <hi>Lye,</hi> nay like the man poſſeſſed with devils amongſt the Tombes, its name is Legion, becauſe they are many.</p>
                     <p>This he ſaith, <hi>hath a Frontiſpiece,</hi> (he ſhould have ſaid an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-frontiſpiece) which pretends to ſhew the manner of Anabaptiſts dipping, but moſt falſly, ſith it repreſents to the eyes of the beholders, as if they held perſons by the heels, when they baptize them, which is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then their practiſe;</hi> To which I return in his own lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, he relates it moſt falſly, ſeing the repreſentation is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than he ſays; for if he had not been (I will not ſay like to <hi>Elymas</hi> the Sorcerer to whom he compares us) ſmit with blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, he might have ſeen they hold them by the hands
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:45475:38"/> and not by the heels; unleſſe their heels be-continued, and immediately joyned to their neck, and ſhoulders, which cannot be imagined, unleſſe like <hi>Uliſses</hi> companions, when thrown into the water, they are Metamorphized into ſwine, their armes tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into leggs, their hands into heeles. And what ſtrange Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digie, if they had been repreſented as held by the heels? Its a known thing that ſome have been thrown in by the hands, but have been pulled out dead by the heels, with this funeral ſermon preached over them; (I tremble to utter it) <hi>You ſee that no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner are they new-born, but God takes them to himſelf.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But this Anti-Paedobaptiſt hath another quarrel at the Anti-frontiſpiece page, which he faſtens upon the Paedobaptiſts, and the frontiſpiece page; which is, <hi>that the pretended manner of laying on of hands, and waſhing of feet is unknown to him,</hi> and yet he ſeems to call it Chriſts appointment, and ſays that <hi>they have likely proofs from</hi> Heb. 6. 2. <hi>and our Saviours practiſe and command</hi> John 13. whence we may gather that there are ſome things of Chriſts ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, and have proof from Scripture and our Saviours pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, and command, which are unknown to him; It ſeems he is but yet a Seeker, and though it were true he diſſented in nothing from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ſave in the Queſtion of Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; By this principle he is lyable to ſtray as far as the German Anabaptiſts. I will not impeach him with Judaiſm, for making a Jewiſh ceremony a binding command; nor faſten contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon him for applying that here to laying on of hands in Baptiſm, which in his <hi>Examen</hi> he interprets to be laying on of hands in Ordination of Miniſters; Let thoſe paſſe; Yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but take notice, that he is ſo confident of his preſent inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of thoſe places, that he ſays <hi>they might have deterred the Author of the Frontiſpiece from expoſing the Ordinance of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, and other Rites to contempt, had he any reverence to holy things.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To which I reply, who was the Author of the Anti-frontiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece page, I know not, and as little whether it was to Idolize, or to expoſe to contempt dipping, or rebaptizing which he calls the Ordinance; But if it were Chriſts Inſtitution, me thinks they ſhould not be afraid to have that expoſed to the eye, which they preach to the ear.</p>
                     <p>But he marches on furiouſly like <hi>Jehu</hi> with whole Waynes la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with reproaches, inveighing againſt the Frontiſpiece of Dr. <hi>Featlies</hi> book, and this, with the Epiſtles, and other paſſages, which (he ſayes) <hi>do give occaſion to Intelligent perſons to conceive
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:45475:39"/> that this ſort of men do make but a ſport of Chriſts Ordinance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for Dr. <hi>Featlie,</hi> he hath given his account already before a higher Bar: ſome like Keſtrils love to be preying over dead car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſes, and with <hi>Therſites</hi> to trample upon the graves of thoſe <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilles</hi>'s, whom they durſt not look in the face when living. The Author of the other is unknown to us, Yet let him know thus much, we reverence Chriſts Ordinance, and have as great a mind to ſearch out, and receive the Truth, as himſelf; and are ſo far from expoſing them that are for re-baptizing, and againſt Infant-Baptiſm, to the contempt of light, and profane wits, and to the hatred of the ignorant, and ſuperſtitious common people (as he uncharitably ſcandalizes them,) that we rather pity them; and would not only ſpend our breath, but our deareſt blood to bring them into unity, and unanimity with their brethren. And whatſoever he conceives; The Book was publiſhed by men of that ſpirit, who endeavoured to bring thoſe home to the fold of Chriſt, who of late had been poyſoned in judgment, and imbit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in affections againſt the reformed Churches, and their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, which he further confirmes them in, calling them <hi>looſe, or formal pretended Ministers;</hi> Which argues a great deale of raſh ignorance in him, ſeeing, he neither knowes Paſtor, or people of theſe parts, ſaving two or three cenſorious Anabaptiſts, upon whoſe credit he takes this uncharitable prejudice, whereas if he had been willing to have been truly informed, he might have found Miniſters as free from looſeneſſe, and formalities, and more conſtant to the principles of truth, and conſcionable, than they that vilifie them, and labours as much for reformation of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, ſuperſtition, profaneneſſe, and ungodlineſſe (which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds leſſe in theſe parts, than under his wing) as the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts does to gain Proſelytes by re-baptizing; which whoſoever in the ſpirit of meekneſs oppoſes, and would keep their flock free from infection, he brands them with the mark of <hi>formall preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Miniſters.</hi>

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:45475:42"/> The firſt is what is the relaters ſenſe of the Anabaptiſts, out of which he picks two propoſitions, and then plants his Ordinance againſt them: The former is the ſaying of <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> That, which the whole Church holds, was never begun by any Councel, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes obſerved, cannot otherwiſe be believed, but that it came from the Apoſtles; The later is, The whole Church always held Infant-Baptiſm; both theſe he denies, which are both <hi>Auſtins;</hi> The former <hi>de Bapt. contra Donatiſt. lib. 4. cap.</hi> 23. The later <hi>Serm. 15. de verb. Apost.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Ile begin with the former; 1. Applying to the Teſt the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, then examine the ſandy ground upon which he denies it; The propoſition which he calls <hi>Auſtins rule</hi> is, That which the univerſal Church holdeth, and was not inſtituted by Councels, but hath been ever held, was not delivered but by Apoſtolical Authority; This I undertake to make good, 1. Diſtinguiſhing of <hi>Church,</hi> 2. Of the <hi>Object,</hi> or that which is holden of the Church.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Church,</hi> is ſometimes taken for the repreſentative of the Church, and that according to the extent, or reſtraint, provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, National, or Oecumenial: Sometimes it is taken eſſential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (as ſome call it) or integrally for the body of profeſſors living at the ſame time, and this either for the major part, which (as in Councels) obtaines the denomination of the whole, or of the whole made up of integrall parts, without any conſiderable exception. Sometime it is taken for all profeſſors of all times, whether ſince the death, and expiration of the Apoſtles, or ſince our Saviours commiſſioning of them, after his reſurrection, or full qualify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them upon the day of Pentecoſt after his aſcenſion, while (as <hi>Egiſippus</hi> ſaid) the Church continued a pure Virgin.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, we muſt diſtinguiſh of the Tenets, or things hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by the Church, which is either matter of Doctrine, or Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline: Diſcipline grounded upon Scripture binding, and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; Or Adiaphorous of Eccleſiaſtical inſtitution, and arbitrary. Theſe grounds thus laid, I raiſe theſe propoſitions. Firſt, its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed A repreſentative Church, whether Provincional, National, or Oecumenial may err, hath erred <hi>de facto</hi> in ſuperſtructures, or things leſs fundamental. 2. Neither Provincional, National, nor Oecumenial repreſentative can erre in fundamentals, for then it would ceaſe to be a Church. 3. The major part of the Church, living at the ſame time, may err, as in the time of <hi>Elias, I only am left</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>that have not bowed my knee to</hi> Baal. <hi>Vnus Athanaſius contra cotum mundum.</hi> 4. The whole Church
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:45475:42"/> conſiſting of all the integral parts cannot erre in matter of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine requiſite to be holden, <hi>I have reſerved ſeven thouſand</hi> (ſays God) <hi>that have not bowed their knee to</hi> Baal; and undoubtedly many beſides <hi>Athanaſius</hi> that in his time were not infected with <hi>Arrianiſm.</hi> 5. The whole Church, ſince the Apoſtles in all ages collectively conſidered, cannot err either in Doctrine, or Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, then Chriſt ſhould not make good his promiſe, <hi>that the gates of Hell ſhould not prevaile against his Church,</hi> that he <hi>would be with it to the end,</hi> that he <hi>would ſend them the Comforter, that would lead them into all t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It is poſſible that the whole Church ſince the Apoſtles may hold an Adiaphorous, or indifferent Diſcipline, or Ceremony, which was not Apoſtolical, or of Divine inſtitution. 7. That which the whole Church holds, hath in all ages holden, including the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, whether it be Doctrine or Diſcipline, muſt needs be Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick and infallible: Of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Two things are objected againſt this Teſtimony, 1. That the reaſon of Baptizing of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, was not the Covenant of grace made to believers, and their ſeed, but that they might obtain ſalvation at the reſurrection; This is ſo far from overthrowing, that it confirmes the reaſon, being in Covenant with the parents (for of ſuch ſpeaks the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor whoſe parents are believers) gives the children capacity to be baptized, and they are baptized, that they may have ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at the reſurrection, for we have no promiſe of the ſalvation of any out of the pales of the viſible Church. The ſecond objection is, that <hi>Perkins, Rivet,</hi> and others, queſtions whether it be <hi>Juſtin Martyrs</hi> book or no.

The other indeed would have the Baptiſm of ſome to be put off, till they were of compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent age to anſwer for themſelves, but were they not (as <hi>Pameli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> and others prove) children of heathens, which is apparent, becauſe he ſpeaks of the danger <hi>Sponſorum</hi> of the Sureties, and nothing of the parents; Secondly, the Author in that Chapter ſpeaks of the Baptiſm of ſuch as were born of Jewiſh, or Heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh parents (as S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the <hi>Eunuch,</hi>) and therefore he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires that the Baptiſm of ſuch Infants may be deferred, till they made confeſſion of ſins, and profeſſion of faith, their parents be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Infidels, and their Sponſors Mortal, the moſt of their kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and neighbours (as it is probable) being Heathens; This doctrine differs nothing from that we hold.</p>

That it was onely in caſe of danger of the neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of death to the Infant. 9. That when reformation of Popiſh abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes was ſought, the reformation of this was ſought with the firſt ſome hundred years before</hi> Luther. Theſe are his nine Worthies, (beſides which many more deſerves cenſure) that come now to be ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, that their deformity may be diſcovered. Firſt the Epiſtle does not affirm that the Baptizing of Believers had its rice, and ſpring from <hi>Nicholas Stork.</hi> The words are theſe, <hi>as all errours, ſo it,</hi> (that is Anabaptiſm) <hi>had its beginning after truth,</hi> The husbandman firſt ſowed good corn, then the enemy tares; and then mentions the moſt notorious Hereticks that aroſe in the ſix firſt Centuries, at the end of which the Myſtery of iniquity began more fully to work, which was firſt <hi>naſcent,</hi> then <hi>creſcent,</hi> then <hi>Regnant,</hi> then Triumphant; And no ſooner appeared a Reformation in <hi>Luthers</hi> time, but there were <hi>Herods</hi> that ſought the life of this Babe, Dragons watching while the woman was travelling, to devour the child, amongſt whom the Anabaptiſts
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:45475:47"/> of <hi>Germany</hi> were moſt venomous, the Author whereof was one <hi>Nicholas Stork,</hi> then <hi>Phiſer, Knipperdoling, Muncer,</hi> with their Tayler King <hi>John Becold</hi> of <hi>Leyden.</hi> Now by what Chymiſtery will Maſter <hi>T.</hi> extract from hence, that the Epiſtle affirms, that the baptizing of believers had its riſe, and ſpring from <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas Stork?</hi> This will be ſtrange Logick, the Anabaptiſts of <hi>Germany</hi> in <hi>Luthers</hi> time were the moſt venomous, or greateſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbers of Reformation, the firſt Author whereof was <hi>Nicholas Stork,</hi> therefore baptizing of believers had its riſe, and ſpring from hence: It is as inconſequent as this, The Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts of <hi>England</hi> have been great diſturbers of our late Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the firſt Author whereof was Maſter <hi>T.</hi> Therefore bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of believers had its ſpring, and riſe from Maſter <hi>T.</hi> True it is, it will follow <hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> that thoſe Anabaptiſts of <hi>Germany</hi> had their ſpring from <hi>Nicholas Stork;</hi> Theſe of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> from Maſter <hi>T.</hi> But that <hi>ſimpliciter</hi> all Anabaptiſts had their ſpring, and riſe from them is a palpable inconſequence; much more that the baptizing of believers had its riſe from thence.</p>
                     <p>Baptizing of believers (we confeſs) had its ſpring from Chriſt, <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> and the Apoſtles; but not onely of actuall belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers excluding Infants; Though Maſter <hi>T.</hi> confeſſes that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants may habitually believe, nay, by extraordinary means have actuall faith. And here by the way obſerve two things. 1. He cunningly alters the ſubject of the Queſtion from Anabaptiſts (that is denyers of Infant Baptiſm, and Rebaptizers of Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed) to Baptizers of believers. Secondly his <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                     <p>The ſecond untruth is, That we call the Baptizers of believers Anabaptiſts: we do (according to the Nottaion of the word) call thoſe Anabaptiſts that refuſe to Baptize Infants of believing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and being baptized by others, rebaptize them, when they come to age, according to Maſter <hi>T.</hi> his judgement, and practiſe, who calls Infant-Baptiſm a nullity, a mockery, that all that will be ſaved muſt be baptized again, when they become actuall believers; and this he puts in execution by making as many Proſelytes by rebaptizing as he can.</p>
                     <pb n="78" facs="tcp:45475:48"/>
                     <p>The third untruth is, that baptizing of believers without Infants, or excluding Infants, had not its ſpring, and riſe from <hi>Nicholas Stork;</hi> The Epiſtle affirmed Anabaptiſm, (which is an other thing) had its ſpring thence; I am content to wave that, and trace him in his own words, and meaning. This is a negative Queſtion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning matter of fact, and is beſt confuted by rendring invalid his own Inſtances alledged againſt it in his writings. <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> the Great; <hi>Gregory Nazianzen, Chryſoſtom, Augustine, Adeoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> &amp;c. Were not baptized when Infants (ſays he) therefore baptizing of believers without infants was before <hi>Nicholas Stork.</hi> This is a ſtrange conſequence, and may be paralleled with this, <hi>Abraham' Iſhmael, Naaman, Ebedmoleſh,</hi> men of forty years old in the wilderneſs beſides many Proſelytes were not circumciſed, when Infants, therefore circumciſing of believers without In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants was antient, or alwayes.</p>
                     <p>The Queſtion is not whether onely Infants were baptized in every Century, for we acknowledge that as <hi>Abraham</hi> was circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, when a hundred years old, <hi>Iſhmael</hi> when thirteen, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes at what age ſoever they became <hi>Proſelytae foederis,</hi> or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into covenant with the Jews; So Jews and Gentiles of what age ſoever were baptized as ſoon as they became Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, not onely in the Primitive, but in ſucceeding ages.</p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Quere</hi> is, whether before <hi>Nicholas Stork,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Leydens</hi> time, Infants of believers <hi>de facto</hi> were excluded from Baptiſm, which the foregoing inſtances do not prove, They prove indeed that thoſe parties were not baptized when Infants; but they do not prove that they were Infants of believing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: Here the Anabaptiſts ſhamefully begs the Queſtion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not able to prove that the Parents of any one of theſe were in covenant or believers when they were born, but rather the quite contrary, as thoſe two worthies Maſter <hi>Marſhall,</hi> and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Baxter,</hi> have cleared beyond exception out of Authentick hiſtories; And that they were not baptized as ſoon, as conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as it is impertinent to the preſent controverſie, ſo it is <hi>fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacia non cauſae ut cauſae,</hi> a Paralogiſm that would impoſe upon us, but frontleſly, that denyall of Infant Baptiſm was the reaſon; The conſequence will be ſtrange, <hi>Conſtantine, Nazianzen, Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, Auguſtine,</hi> &amp;c. deferred their baptiſm after their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, therefore Infant-baptiſm was not in thoſe days, either <hi>de jure,</hi> or <hi>de facto.</hi> It concludes as this, Proſelytes of the gate deferred their circumciſion after their converſion, therefore In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants then were not circumciſed.</p>
                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:45475:48"/>
                     <p>The true reaſons why they ſuperſtitiouſly deferred Baptiſm were theſe. 1. An imitation of Chriſt, who was not baptized till he was thirty years of age. 2. An ambition to be baptized in the ſame place where Chriſt was, that is <hi>Jordan,</hi> thus <hi>Constantine,</hi> and <hi>Valentinian,</hi> but fell ſho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>, the one was baptized at <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>media,</hi> where he dyed, the other expired without Baptiſm. 3. Some deferred Baptiſm, till they could receive it from ſome Biſhop of an eminent Sea, which ambition <hi>Nazianzen</hi> reproves. 4. Some thought Baptiſm waſhed away all their ſins, therefore they deferred it, as <hi>Gregory Nyſſen</hi> records, <hi>ſine carne abutar, &amp; tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi libidine fruar,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Baptiſmum tum demum ſuſcipiam, cum à vitu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; iniquitatibus deſiſtam,</hi> give me leave to abuſe the fleſh, and to enjoy my filthy luſts, then at the length I will undertake Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, when I can give over my vices, and iniquities. 5. Some thought that Baptized perſons might live, and not ſin, or if they ſinned after baptiſm, their ſin was unpardonable, abuſing that place, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4. Thus the Novations, to one whereof the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Theodoſius</hi> ſaid well, if it be ſo that none can be ſaved that ſins after Baptiſm, <hi>fac tibi Aceſi ſcalam, per quam aſcendas ſolus ad Coelum, Aceſius,</hi> make thy ſelf a ladder, by which thou mayeſt alone aſcend to Heaven. 6. Some put off Baptiſm, to avoid per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution: by Imperiall decrees it was forbidden to buy, ſell, eat, drink, or converſe with Chriſtians, as <hi>Euſebius,</hi> and <hi>Socrates</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, the very name of a Chriſtian was odious, <hi>bonus <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ir</hi> Caius Seius <hi>in hoc tantum malus quod Chriſtianus, Caius Seius</hi> was a good man (ſays the ſtorie) in this onely blame-worthy, that he was a Chriſtian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7. Even Infant-Baptiſm out of urgent neceſſity, not ſcruple of conſcience might be deferred, which makes nothing againſt the preſent Tenet, as upon theſe, or the like occaſions. 1.

It fell out ſometimes, that the Orthodox lived amongſt Hereticks, who corrupted the faith and grated the foundation, and therefore they would not have their children baptized by them, like <hi>Antiochus,</hi> who refuſed to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by <hi>Jovinian</hi> an <hi>Arrian</hi> Biſhop, which was not ſimply to refuſe ordination, but <hi>ad hoc</hi> from ſuch profane hands: ſo they

                     <p>The fourth untruth is, that Infant-baptiſm was not comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Chriſt, which neither Maſter <hi>T.</hi> nor any other Antipaedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſt will ever be able to prove, ſeeing the Commiſſion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends as well to baptiſm of Infants, as other ages, <hi>Math.</hi> 28. 19, 20.

                     <p>Secondly here is the Acte <hi>baptize,</hi> that is as the Jews Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and Proſelytes were admitted into Covenant by Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, oblation and waſhing, which was but their Typicall, ſo thoſe that are <hi>Candidati,</hi> and <hi>deſignati ſanctitatis,</hi> whether thoſe that are willing to receive the Ordinance, or their children are to be initiated by baptiſm, or waſhing, which is to be the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward badge, or Character of my Covenant.</p>

                     <p>The fifth untruth is, that Infant-baptiſm was not practiſed by the Apoſtles, which being denyed by the Anti-Paedobaptiſts, the proof lyes upon them, which they will performe <hi>ad Graecas Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendas.</hi> A Negative Argument in matter of fact of this nature is of no validity, no mention is made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>IN the firſt Paragraph he undertakes to anſwer to the third head of the Epiſtle, the reaſons of the preſent grouth, and increaſe of Anabaptiſm, wherein he forges a Chimera mounted upon theſe four wings. 1. That the aſſignation of the cauſes of Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſm are vain, 2. That Anabaptiſm, that is repeating of Baptiſm) is true Baptiſm. 3. That the true cauſe of Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, is the ſhining forth of light from Scriptures, and other Authors. 4. That this light was not diſcovered formerly as now. Theſe <hi>Icarian</hi> engines wings him from his labyrinth of error, but are in danger to betray him to the Sea of groſſe miſtakes, as will appear when they are expoſed to the beams of the ſun, that is, the true light of diſcovery. Firſt that the aſſignation of the cauſes of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſm are vain; This he affirms, &amp; yet names not one of them, but turns his back (as the Souldier did from <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he could not endure the darting beams of his eys.

Times of diviſion, wherein the hedge of diſcipline is broken down; liberty in religion, is like free converſing without reſtraint, or watch in time of peſtilence, one houſe eaſily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects a whole City. 2. Satans malice like a river the further it goes the deeper, and fiercer. 3. The corruption of mans nature more inclinable to errour than truth. 4. The fitneſs of the engin for devaſtation, and ruinating all former Churches, under co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of firſt baptiſms nullity, gathering of new ones (after their own mould) out of the old ruines by rebaptizing. 5. The pretence that children are uncapable of Church-memberſhip, or commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Saints, as if there were not the ſame capacity under the Goſpel, which was under the law. 6. Falſe allegation that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptiſm is occaſion of looſe living, as if the native Jewes, that were ſealed, when Infants, were more diſſolute than the Proſelites. 7. To limit it to ripe years increaſes piety; as if Jewes, and Turks, and their rebaptized converts, were not more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently guilty of Apoſtacie, and hipocriſie. 8. Not underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that Infants Church memberſhip in the Old Teſtament is not repealed, but confirmed in the new. 9. A carnal eſtimation
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:45475:55"/> that the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> was partly carnal, of which circumciſion is a part, as if godlineſſe in both Teſtaments had not the promiſe of this life, and of the life to come. 10. That circumciſion was the ſeal of righteouſneſs of faith to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and not his poſterity. 11. That the Covenant was made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his ſpiritual ſeed only, and not with viſible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors. 12. That there is no ſuch thing as national Churches, though Chriſt ſayes, make diſciples of all Nations, and <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſayes, all Nations ſhall flow in, yet they ſay, all Churches muſt be gathered by actual profeſſion as well in Chriſtian Nations as amongſt Turks and Pagans. 13. Becauſe we have no particular inſtance in <hi>Terminis</hi> that any Infants were baptized, and becauſe they are not expreſly named in the precept, as if generals did not include particulars, as well for Infants as old men. 14. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying equivalencies, and neceſſary conſequencies from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. 15. A vilifying the judgment and perſons of all godly, and learned men of this preſent, and former ages, building up their rotten foundation upon their ruines. 16. Temporal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of the loweſt of the people, which while they dream it is countenanced by men in power, cry <hi>Hoſanna,</hi> and perhaps cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie to morrow. 17. A pretending to the Spirit of God. <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> feigned that he converſed with the goddeſs <hi>Egeria, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos</hi> with <hi>Jupiter</hi> in the Cave; <hi>Solon</hi> with the Delphian <hi>Apollo, Mahomet</hi> with the Angel <hi>Gabriel; Montanus,</hi> and the Quakers with the Holy Ghoſt; the white Witches with the ſpirit in the ſhape of a dove, and all but to palliate their unſound opinions, and practiſes. 18.

Thus farr the aſſignation of the reaſons of Anabaptiſm which he ſayes are vain; a cenſure how juſt, let wiſe men judge, who clearly ſee that the meeting of ſeveral beaſts at <hi>Nilus</hi> does not more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly beget new Monſters, nor putrefaction ingender ſeveral vermins, than the fore-aſſigned reaſons occaſion the grouth, and increaſe of Anabaptiſm.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Allegation is, that Anabaptiſm is true Baptiſm,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:45475:55"/> A ſtrange Paradox, which either implies that Infant-Baptiſm is a nullity, or that true baptiſm may be iterated, or received more than once; The confutation of the former is the ſcope of this preſent treatiſe <hi>rectum &amp; ſui, &amp; curvi index.</hi> The latter that true Baptiſm may be iterated (as the notation of the word, and their practiſe interprets it) is now to be queſtioned; And that I fight not with the ayre, or an adverſary of mine own fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming may appear from Mr. <hi>T.</hi> who examen <hi>pag.</hi> 23. begges an Argument of Mr. <hi>Martial</hi> to prove reiteration of Baptiſm to be intrinſecally unlawfull, and that in the tone of the Marcionites and Aetians, who in ſeveral Councells have been whipt for it, and have received theſe, and the like reaſons for their paſport. 1. In the inſtitution of Baptiſm there is neither expreſly, nor conſequently any mention of reiteration of it, as in the Lords Supper, <hi>Quotieſcunque feceritis,</hi> as often as ye ſhall do it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and whatſoever is not of faith is ſin, whatſoever is not grounded on Scripture is will-worſhip, there is no inſtance, or preſident in Scripture that any one was baptized twice, for thoſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 3. 4. were either firſt baptized metonymically, that is initiated with the doctrine of <hi>John,</hi> and then afterwards baptized with water as ſome ſay; or adulteratly baptized with falſe Baptiſm (as <hi>Ambroſe</hi> thinks) and then with true Baptiſm; or baptized firſt with <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm, and then with Chriſts, which (as <hi>Auſtin</hi> conceives) are two diſtinct Baptiſmes; or which is moſt conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Text, firſt baptized by <hi>John</hi> with water, then by the Apoſtle with the Holy Ghoſt, and fire, that is the miraculous gifts of the Holy Ghoſt; None of theſe make for the reiterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſame baptiſm; beſides there is expreſs Scripture againſt it. <hi>Epheſ. 4. 5. one Lord, one faith, one Baptiſm.</hi> 2. Baptiſm is the Sacrament of regeneration, or new birth; and as <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath it as we are carnally, and naturally born but once, ſo we are ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, and ſupernaturally new born but once; faith though it admit of grandations begins but once, Bapt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſm that matriculates us into Chriſts Schole, is to be performed but once; Therefore even <hi>Cyprian</hi> himſelf, and his followers never baptized any whom they thought were truly baptized before: 3. Baptiſm ſucceeds Circumciſion which was but once adminiſtred, as appears from that of <hi>Joſhuah</hi> 5. 4. where the Holy Ghoſt gives this reaſon why <hi>Joſhuah</hi> circumciſed the Iſraelites in <hi>Gilgal?</hi> Becauſe all the circumciſed were dead, intimating if they had been
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:45475:56"/> circumciſed already, it ſhould not have been done again. And ſeeing circumciſion was tyed to the eight day from the birth, till a ſecond eight day beſides the firſt can be found, it cannot be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified without ſacriledge.</p>
                     <p>His third allegation that the true cauſe of Anabaptiſm is ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning forth of l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Yea the ſole and adequate rule of our faith? Scripture (its true) may impart its light to other Authors, as the Sun empties his rayes (as the Aſtronomers ſpeak) <hi>in inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ores crateras,</hi> into inferiour ſublunary veſſels; If the Scripture have thus emptied it ſelf for the advantage of Anabaptiſm, they might do well to let it appear, produce one ſol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Indeed they may fancy to themſelves abundance of light out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, like ſick perſons in ſome diſeaſe, when death approaches thinks, that ſtore of tapers, and torches are lighted about the bed, when the candle is out; the cauſe is in the diſtemper of the brain, and eye, and if the ſpiritual eye of the ſoul be darken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                     <p>The fourth Allegation is, <hi>That this light out of Scripture, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Authors was not diſcerned formerly as now.</hi> Some of our Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts are of opinion that Chriſt never locally aſcended into heaven, but onely vaniſhed out of ſight and is yet bodily upon the earth, vouchſafing his apparition to the Saints now, which he did not in former ages; This is either a diabolical fiction, or a deluding Phantaſm; like to this, is the pretended light out of Scripture, and other Authors for Anabaptiſm not diſcerned formerly as now. Did <hi>Berengarius</hi> ſee more than the primative Fathers, and Martyrs? The Albigenſes of <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonymi</hi> more then <hi>Berengarius: Peter de Bruis</hi> more than the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bigenſes? <hi>Baltazzar, Hubmir, Pacimontanus, Muncer,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Leyden</hi> more than <hi>Peter de Bruis?</hi> And Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> as a child upon theſe Giants ſhoulders ſees further into childrens baptiſm than they all?

But that there is ſhining light out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and other Authors not formerly diſcerned about Infant-Baptiſm (otherwiſe than that by oppoſition the truth is more cleared) I fear is but a bragg like <hi>Oromazes</hi> in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> who boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted he had an Egge that had included in it the happineſs of the world, which being broken proved a wind-egg, and nothing came forth, but corrupted aire.

                     <p>In anſwer to the fourth head of the Epiſtle, why the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts were permitted, and their books printed, ſeing thoſe of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> Dr. <hi>Pocklingtons,</hi> Mr. <hi>Archers</hi> were burned, he paſſes by the reaſons there aſſigned, which are theſe, 1.

                     <p>The wiſdome of the State, that like wiſe Chirurgians will not launce a turgid ulcer, till it be ripe; A skilfull Phiſitian that will not purge ſome floating humors till they be ſettled, Theſe he calls the Epiſtlers own ignorant ſurmiſes, when they are not his own, but in effect of the whole Church,; not ignorant ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, but the judgment of moſt learned men, wherein conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently he accuſes many former Councells, Synods, Harmonies of confeſſions, Parliaments, Canon, Civill, Statute laws, many former Treatiſes of learned Divines, and the late Aſſembly, of ignorant ſurmiſes.</p>
                     <p>The true reaſon (ſayes he) why their books, and practiſe is permitted, is becauſe they have at leaſt, ſo much appearance of truth as is ſufficient to make wiſe men to let them alone, leaſt they haply ſhould fight againſt God; This is the <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                     <p>Anabaptiſm is a Magazine of all ſubtiltie, fortified, and ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitioned with all ſorts of Paralogiſmes, and Elenches of Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie.

                     <p>What ſucceſſe the Diſputes at <hi>Bewdley, Hereford, Roſs,</hi> and <hi>Abergaveny</hi> had (he ſayes) is not ſo proper for him to enquire; whether proper or no, we cannot believe but that he is ſo carefull a husbandman, when he hath planted, and watered, he will look after the increaſe; or if he enquire not, others will be apt to tel him; (which he confeſſeth afterward) for Fame hath an hundred feet, an hundred wings, an hundred mouthes. That at <hi>Bewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> (he implyedly confeſſes) hath had ſucceſs for Infant-Baptiſm, but preſently he ſends up a ſwarm of Locuſts to dimm this light. 1. Affirming that it was publiſhed in an unbrotherly manner. 2. That it diverted many from truth. 3. That they were willing to be deluded. 4. That they were caught with a cheat. 5. That the book ſtiled plain Scripture proof for Infant-Baptiſm, is a Mock<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> titled book. All which calumnies, Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor hath anſwered with that dexterity, ſolidity, and ſatisfaction to the impartial reader, that whoſoever ſhall go about to add a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, may ſeem to poure water into the Sea, and light a candle to the Sun.</p>
                     <p>The reſt of the Diſputes (he ſayes) have not gained any credit to Paedobaptiſm, but with theſe two limitations, 1. That he hears, 2. Among the Intelligent. What he hears we know not, onely this we know, that what he hears at ſuch a diſtance, is from the Anabaptiſts, who ſince by dipping they have took poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of that Element, thinks with Lunatick <hi>Thraſilaus</hi> at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> that every ſhip that comes to the ſhore is their own; Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Text of Scripture like the Catadupes of <hi>Nilus,</hi> ſounds nothing but plunging. Now who theſe Intelligent are, with whom the Diſputes have gained no credit, we may eaſily conjecture, none
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:45475:59"/> of them that are for the prophane abuſe of Infant-Sprinkling: Which amounts to this, that none but the Anabaptiſts are Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent; who, as if they had the ſole Monopoly of Intelligencies, ought in his judgment to move the Sphears in theſe inferiour orbes of Church, and Commonweale. With theſe we confeſs the Diſputes have gained no more credit, than <hi>Luthers</hi> reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath done with the Jeſuits; Saint <hi>Peters</hi> miracles with the Diſciples of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> or our Saviours Diſputes with the unconverted Sadduces.

                     </p>
                     <p>To the Sixt Quere of the Epiſtle, he confeſſes that he was importuned to viſit ſome friends at <hi>Abergaveny,</hi> which for ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years he had deſerted, and though often requeſted in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, would not vouchſafe then a viſit, till the cauſe brought him. There (he ſayes) he preached, and that's true; and ſome things the letter mentions he ſpake, and does ſtill avouch; But what he ſpake, and does ſtill avouch, he tells us not, that by this Enthymematical reſervation he may have a loophole of evaſion in all Emergencies. The things the Epiſtle mentions he ſpake were theſe. That Infant-Baptiſm was a nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, a mockery: no Baptiſm but by dipping, or plunging was lawfull, that all that would be ſaved, muſt be rebaptized, or baptized after profeſſion; That there was no ſuch thing as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptiſm in the Primitive times, but that came in with other corruptions upon unſound grounds; whether he will avouch all this, or no, many others will, that he delivered them, whoſe credit, and Teſtimonies (no diſparagement to him) are as Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick as his.</p>
                     <p>And whereas the Epiſtle ſayes there were many well learned that heard him, eſpecially two, Mr. <hi>Bonner,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Vaughan,</hi> who both for the preſent kept ſilence, when out of the pulpit he challenged the whole Congregation to ſpeak, if they had any thing to ſay, contrary to that he had delivered. Onely Maſter <hi>Bonner</hi> cloſed with him in the way to his lodging, and told him he had delivered ſome thing contrary to that he had read in the Antients, and other things that grieved his ſpirit to hear, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired therefore to conferr with him there about the next morning, and that he ſlighted the grave old Gentleman with as much

For the Sermon, though it was the gleanings of two, it had not the entire retiredneſſe of one day, as thoſe that knew my other imployments, will eaſily believe.</p>
                     <p>For the words following I concur with him, <hi>that it diſpleaſeth not me, that the buſineſſe ſhould be truly ſtated, which is the end alſo of this my writing;</hi> Though it diſpleaſe me that he ſhould firſt give the aſſault, and then raiſe the hubbub.

His next expreſſions preſages ſome good hope, that he that here begins to write his Confeſſions, may hereafter with <hi>Auſtin</hi> write his retractions; for he grants it is not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable <hi>that he might in five hours Diſpute with one who talked ſo fast, as to give no time to consider of what he ſaid, anſwered not ſo clearly as he would, had he had the Arguments to view, and examine deliberatly.</hi> In the wombe of which Monſter, three untruthes are couched; Firſt, that he <hi>diſputed five hours with me,</hi> when the whole was ſhort of that, and almoſt two thereof ſpent with Mr. <hi>V.</hi> Secondly, that I <hi>talked ſo faſt, as to give him no time to consider of what he ſaid,</hi> whereas I did not only ſpeak treatibly, but was often forced to repeat the Syllogiſm twice, or thrice.

                     <p>Might it not more likely, (I will not ſay truly) have been compleated in <hi>Darii,</hi> thus; All beſides them that are excluded Baptiſm, may be baptized; There are ſome Infants beſides them that are excluded Baptiſm, therefore ſome Infants may be baptized.

                     <hi>THE next Argument is concerning the Eſſence of Baptiſm, which he ſaith belongeth to Infants; Therefore they may be baptized, and then Inſinuates me to have been driven to abſurdities in denying that Baptiſm is a relation, and</hi> Auſtins <hi>definition of a Sacrament.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>To which I anſwer, 1. This propoſition the eſſence of Baptiſm be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to Infants, may have two ſenſes. 1. That the Baptiſm of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants is true Baptiſm, that is, is according to Tranſcendental verity, ſuch as hath the true nature of Baptiſm, and in this ſenſe I grant the Propoſition is true, and ſo it is true that an Infants eating bread, and drinking wine, is true eating and drinking the Lords Supper, it hath the Eſſence of it; But this I did not imagine he meant, and therefore denied his Minor, till his next Syllegiſm ſhewed he meant it, and then I perceived I ſhould have denyed the Major; but his quickneſſe, and multiplying words would not permit me to recall my ſelf. 2. The other ſenſe is this, The Eſſence of Baptiſm, that is, that which is of the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence to right adminiſtration of Baptiſm belongs to Infants, in which ſenſe I denyed it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nor doth his Argument from the definition prove it, for it is all one as to argue, Infant-Baptiſm is Baptiſm, therefore it is right Baptiſm; As for the abſurdities he imputes to me, I deny them to be abſurdities. For I take Baptiſm to be either an Action, or Paſſion, though Chriſtian Baptiſm have a relation ſuper added, and ſo in the uſe is a ſigne, and the Genus of it, which is of the Eſſence, I ſhould make an Action. As for the other abſurdity, I do confeſs, that the term Sacrament, being but a term invented by Latine Fathers may be layd aſide, nor is there any common nature of Sacraments expreſſed in Scripture. And I confeſſe I take</hi> Auſtins <hi>definition, if it be his, that a Sacrament is a viſible ſign of inviſible grace, to be but imperfect, ſith it may be applyed to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent of the Holy Ghoſt as a dove, Chriſt waſhing of his Diſciples feet, a perſons kneeling, and holding up his hands to pray, the kiſſing of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and many other actions which are not Sacraments.

Here he confeſſes he denyed the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, where he ſhould have denyed the Major; And which is worſe, though he perceived by my next Syllogiſm he was miſtaken, he could not recall himſelf by reaſon of my quickneſs, and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying words would not permit him; pittifull figge leaves; Did not he firſt heare the Argument from me, and then repeat it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, what quickneſs? Is not the Syllogiſm briefly couched, that took away his Minor, what multiplying of words?</p>
                     <p>But now he makes amends, and repaires the loſs by a diſtinction of a twofold Eſſence of Baptiſm, which is a meer <hi>Cymera,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an <hi>Ens fictum</hi> impoſſible, never heard before; for as <hi>Ens</hi> is <hi>unum</hi> but one, ſo <hi>Eſſentia una,</hi> eſſence is but one: who ever read of this new Divinity, and Metaphyſicks, that the eſſence of Baptiſm belonging to Infants may have two ſenſes? Firſt, (as he gloſſes it) that the baptiſm of Infants is true Baptiſm, that is according to tranſcendental verity, ſuch as hath the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Baptiſm; And in this ſenſe he grants the propoſition is true, that the eſſence of Baptiſm belongs to Infants; The other ſenſe is, the eſſence of Baptiſm, that is, that which is of the eſſence to the right adminiſtration of Baptiſm belongs to Infants, in which ſenſe (he ſayes) he denyes, that the eſſence of Baptiſm belongs to Infants; as if the eſſence were not indiviſible, that they that had one part, had all, wanted one part, wanted all; For as <hi>Euſtachius</hi> hath it, <hi>Metaphyſ. pag.</hi> 21. every created eſſence conſiſts of parts Phyſical, or Metaphyſical, <hi>eatenus tamen dicuntur indiviſibiles quod nulla ſit natura, quae ſecundum naturam ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam inaequaliter participetur ab individuis,</hi> Therefore eſſences are called indiviſible, becauſe there is nothing of nature that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſpecifical reaſon may be unequally participated of Individuals; As appears by induction, humane nature belongs
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:45475:66"/> not more to one man than another, ſo that one man cannot more be ſaid to be a man than another, and he gives a reaſon, becauſe nothing that belongs to the eſſence of a thing can be added, or withdrawn, but preſently the nature and eſſence is changed, whence <hi>Ariſtotle Metaphyſ. 8. cap. 3. Tom.</hi> 10. compares eſſences to numbers, to which if we add, or ſubſtract but an union, the ſame ſpecifical number is changed, hence the reſult is, if the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Baptiſm belongs to Infants, then indiviſibly, and equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to them, with thoſe of riper age, but Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> being Judge, the eſſence of Baptiſm according to Tranſcendental verity belongs to Infants, therefore Baptiſm belongs indiviſibly, and equally to Infants with them of riper years; Neither will his parallel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance relieve him, that <hi>Infants eating bread, and drinking wine, is true eating, and drinking the Lords Supper, and have the eſſence of it,</hi> which is his groundleſſe dictate, and hath no truth in it, for up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuppoſition that Infants are excluded the Lords Supper in the divine inſtitution, which is the fundament, and gives being to the relation, they are no more capable of the eſſence, and true eating of the Lords Supper while Infants, than degs, and mice, which how ridiculouſly the Canoniſts of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute whether they eat the Lords Supper, or no, every man of common ſenſe knowes; As for the other part of the diſtinction, which he alſo calls the eſſence of Baptiſm, it is ſo farr from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the eſſence of it, as his own terms (right adminiſtration) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, that it is but an accidental perfection ſuperadded to the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. If his diſtinct on had been of the truth of Baptiſm, it might have had ſome ground in it, though not as applyed to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants; for as the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and other Churches that holds the fundamentals, according to Biſhop <hi>Hall,</hi> and <hi>Davenant</hi> are true Churches in tranſcendental verity, but in relation to their erronious ſuperſtructions, they are not true Churches, <hi>eatenus</hi> in moral verity.

                        </gap>tie. Whereas Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> confeſſes Infants may have the eſſence of Baptiſm, or that it belongs to them, which the Argument from the defin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tion further proves, in forme thus. To whom belongs the definition of Baptiſm, to them belongs the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:45475:66"/> to ſome Infants belongs the definition of Baptiſm, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſome Infants belongs the eſſence; This is no Identical probation, or all one (as he ſayes) as to argue Infant-Baptiſm is Baptiſm, therefore it is right Baptiſm, it is not Identical, for an Argument taken from the definition is a demonſtration, <hi>â priori, &amp; notiori,</hi> from the former, and better known: It is not all one to argue Infant-Baptiſm is Baptiſm, therefore it is right Baptiſm, but it concludes Infant-Baptiſm is Baptiſm, therefore Infants may be baptized, which is the Queſtion by this inference put out of Queſtion. And if we make a deeper Scrutinie into the parts of the definition, we ſhall find that their Baptiſm is right Baptiſm, and that Infants may rightly be baptized, for the entire definition of Baptiſm comprehends in its wombe theſe parts, 1. The fundament, which is the divine Inſtitution infolding Infants in all Nations, in ſeveral families, 2. The principal cauſe, the Holy Ghoſt, of which they are capable, what then can forbid water? 3. The Inſtrumental cauſe, the Miniſter, whoſe commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion extends to them, <hi>go baptize all Nations.</hi> 4. The matterial cauſe, <hi>water,</hi> of which Chriſtian children are as capable, as the Jewiſh children were of Circumciſion. 5. The formal cauſe alſo, into the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt. 6. Tho correlative Chriſt, of whoſe Union, children are receptive. 7. The final cauſe, grace, and glory, from which they cannot be excluded, for <hi>to ſuch belongs the Kingdom of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this is the Argument perticulariſed by which I proved the definition of Baptiſm belonged to Infants thus; The definition of Baptiſm, as of all other relations, is made up of the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, correlative, and <hi>Termini,</hi> but all theſe three, <hi>Fundamentum, Correlatum,</hi> and <hi>Terminus</hi> belongs to Infants, therefore the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of Baptiſm belongs to Infants.

                     </p>
                     <p>Now the Argument whereby in the Diſpute I proved Baptiſm to be a relation, was this, Every Sacrament is a relation, Baptiſm is a Sacrament, therefore Baptiſm is a Relation. Then he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed both the premiſſes, but now minces it, ſaying that he confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that the terme Sacrament, being but a term invented by Latine Fathers, may he layd aſide: What Latine Fathers? The <hi>duode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cim Tabulae?</hi> For they mention it; There was among the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Heathen Romans <hi>Sacramentum militare,</hi> a Souldiers Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereby Plantiff, and defendant put in gages to abide the tryal, this <hi>Tully</hi> alludes too <hi>pro Milone Sacramentis alienos fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos petunt,</hi> They ſue for other mens grounds with Sacraments, or gages of mony. Therefore the Terme Sacrament was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by the Chriſtian Latine Fathers, but was long before them: Perhaps he means the terme Sacrament to ſpeake properly, was not invented but applyed to Baptiſm, and the Lords Supper by the Latine Chriſtian Fathers, &amp; therefore may be laid aſide, becauſe a heathen word; So the terms <hi>Epiſcopus, Presbyter, Diaconus,</hi> ſhould be laid aſide, for the Areopagites, and other Grecians had them, Ile inſtance in one, <hi>Epiſcopus, Plutarch in Pericle</hi> ſayes, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                        </gap>, by way of eminence. And that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm was both a Sacrament, and a relation was further proved. That which is an outward and viſible ſigne, of an inward and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible grace, is both a Relation, and a Sacrament; Baptiſm is an outward and viſible ſigne of an inward and inviſible grace, Therefore it is both a Relation, and a Sacrament. Then he denied the Minor; now he ſpeaks not quite out, but clou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>For the former, that there is no common nature of a Sacrament expreſſed in Scripture is untrue, both in the ſequel, and in it ſelf; In the ſequel, for what conſequence? there is no common nature of a Sacrament expreſſed in Scripture, therefore Baptiſm is not a Sacrament more than in this? There is no common nature of infuſed grace expreſſed in Scripture, therefore faith is not an infuſed grace. Untrue in it ſelf, for though not in one place, there may be in many places of Scripture compared toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (like garlands of flowers gathered out of the ſame garden) a common nature of a Sacrament expreſſed, as well as of predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, election, adoption, regeneration, hope, with many more, which Scripture in no one place, undertakes completely to define, but the common nature thereof, (if he mean the Genus, and the ſpecial nature, the <hi>differentia</hi>) may be gathered by comparing of Scriptures: And is there not the common nature of a Sacrament expreſſed in one Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

Beginning with the firſt, <hi>That God did inſtitute Baptiſm for Infants,</hi> which was concluded thus, He that appointed Infants Church-members under the Goſpell, did inſtitute Baptiſm for them, God appointed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants Church-members under the Goſpell, Therefore God did inſtitute Baptiſm for Infants. To this he anſwered, firſt the Major might be queſtioned, becauſe to be Church-members (whereas he ſhould have ſaid Church-members under the Goſpel) and to be baptized, were not <hi>termini convertibiles;</hi> This I gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for Infants under the Law were Church-members, and yet not baptized, but circumciſed, and before the Law, Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and yet neither circumciſed, nor baptized, but under the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:45475:69"/> Goſpel they were ſo convertible, that all that were baptized were Church-members, and all that were Church-members were to be baptized, which was that I affirmed now in the Major, and as I avouched was a truth ſo clear, that Mr. <hi>T.</hi> confeſſes it all along in his books, and that upon that confeſſed Ground, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> goes in many of his Arguments. This he denyed till a Gentleman told him that he heard him affirm the ſame in his Sermon the day before, this he then let paſſe, but now cements it thus, with this untempered morter; in the firſt words of his former Paragraph thus, <hi>As for that which he ſaith I denyed all that were Church members were to be baptized, and yet affirmed in my Sermon, that they were to be baptized, in both I ſaid true, the former being underſtood of inviſible, the later of viſible Church-members, hence he would imply that all-inviſible Church-members may not be baptized, all viſible Church-members may be baptized:</hi> This is his Cardinal diſtinction upon the hinge whereon hangs the whole Fabrick of his Anti Paedobaptiſtical Babel, and like the ſtring in the Lamprey, runs with a poyſonous and fallacious vein through the whole body of his diſcourſe, whereby he eludes all Arguments, as the Sophiſter did with his Archipodialiter, and reflexive. Let him give me leave to parley with him a little; and firſt tell him that his diſtinction (if true) is not fitly applyed to this place. 2. That it is untrue. Not fitly applyed to this place, for the propoſition by him denyed, points only at the viſible Church-memberſhip of Infants, adjudging it an abſurd thing to draw an Argument to prove a viſible Ordinance taken from the qualification of a ſubject inviſible; So that if he pleaſe he may frame the Propoſition thus. He that appointed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants viſible Church-members under the Goſpel, did inſtitute Baptiſm for them, and then he might have ſpared his viſible, and inviſible diſtinction. 2. It is not true, for neither are all viſible members of the Church to be baptized, then all baptized before (they being viſible members) were to be baptized again, and ſo <hi>toties, quoties,</hi> that all ſhould turn Hemerobaptiſts, be baptized e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day; and if Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſay this is a fallacie, it is but paying him in his own coyne, for theſe are his counterfeit pieces <hi>pag.</hi> 16.

In anſwer to which he ſayes, had not Mr. <hi>C.</hi> quickneſs hindred him, he had ſhewed the vanity of the Major, as well as denyed the Minor; He might have ſet the ſaddle upon the right—, and ſaid his own dulneſs, for as <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> told <hi>Seriphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> if he had not loſt the Caſtle, he could not have won it; So I may tell him, if his ſlowneſs had not hindred, my pretended quickneſs (who gave him leave to Iterate, and reiterate the Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſm) could not have prevented his mature, and deliberate an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. But why had he ſhewed the vanity of the Major? He gives a reaſon (ſuch as it is) if I mean by [Church-members] viſible Church-members, and by [actually receiving into Covenant] underſtand ſuch an actual receiving, as is without any act of Faith, or profeſſion of the perſons received into Covenant (as he conceives I do) he denies the Major. He conceives I mean by Church-members; viſible Church-members, Its true I doe ſo; Why did not he conceive I meant ſo in the former Syllogiſm, and ſpared his diſtinction of viſible, and inviſible Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; which it ſeems by his own confeſſion is but a falſe concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Mooncalfe, for if he conceived I meant viſible Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members, why talks he vainly of inviſible? If he had a conceit I meant inviſible, why ſayes he, that he conceives I meant viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? but that any poor ſhift will fit to elude an Argument. But the main ground upon which he denies the propoſition, is becauſe there can be no actual receiving into Covenant without an act of faith, or profeſſion of the perſons received; How impertinent, and ſenſleſs this is, will appear by the bare repetition of it, which is this. <hi>Thoſe whom God did promiſe before the Law, foretell under the Law, actually receive into Covenant under the Goſpel, thoſe God did appoint Church-members under the Goſpell;</hi> The truth of this propoſition hath no dependance upon faith, or profeſſion, which is but Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> his dream, but upon a threefold impregnable rock, firſt Gods promiſe which is founded upon his veracity, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly his prediction which is founded upon his omniſciency, and infallibility, thirdly, from the intrinſecal connexion of the terms, which makes it to be <hi>aeternae veritatis;</hi> for actually to receive into

What can be more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd than to affirm, that what God hath promiſed, foretold, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, is not executed?

He that is actually received into covenant is in Co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>venant, and he that is in Covenant, is actually received into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, it being impoſſible to be in Covenant (properly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) without being actually received into it.

                     <p>Firſt, That a perſon may be in Covenant, who is not yet born or conceived, as his inſtance of <hi>Iſaak</hi> implies, may be confuted <hi>inſito Argumento,</hi> by an Argument inbred in the terms, for he implyes, and that right, that a perſon muſt be the ſubject of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Covenant, but none who is unborn, and unconceived as <hi>Iſaak, Gen.</hi> 17. 21. is a perſon; for a perſon muſt be a ſubſtance, which excludes all Accidents from Covenant capacity; <hi>à ſubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia prima,</hi> muſt exiſt, and be cloathed with individual circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which excludes univerſals, muſt be Intelligent, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes all irrational creatures, Incommunicable, which excludes the Divine nature; No part of another, which excludes the ſoul or body of man, after ſeparation to be perſons; Not ſupported of another, which excludes the humane nature of Chriſt, becauſe it is ſupported of the Divine. Now that which is unborn, not conceived, or organized in the womb, is therefore uncapable of being a perſon, which by his own confeſſion is the ſubject of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Covenant.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It is a falſe ſuggeſtion, that to have a Covenant made to one, is to be in Covenant, if by having the Covenant made to one (for the phraſe is ſomewhat ſtrange) he means (as he can mean nothing elſe) a promiſe from God to be, and be in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, for a promiſe may be made to, or of one long before he have any being, not executed, or performed till long after his being; Then to be elected, and to be in Covenant would be both one; then <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> while poſſeſſed with ſeven Devills,

                     <p>Thirdly it is of the ſame leaven of untruth, that <hi>Iſaak</hi> was in covenant, when he was not yet born, which his own quotation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 21. proves againſt him: The words are theſe, <hi>But my covenant will I eſtabliſh with</hi> Iſaak, <hi>which</hi> Sara <hi>ſhall bear i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

By this you ſee it ſmels rank of hereſie, if not of blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie, to affirm that a perſon cannot actually be received into covenant, till by ſome acts of his own he engageth himſelf to be Gods: for then all Infants from <hi>Adam</hi> till <hi>Abraham; Iſaak</hi> and all circumciſed Infants from <hi>Abraham</hi> till Chriſt, from Chriſt till the end of the world, nay, Chriſt himſelf, while an Infant (who as he was the firſt begotten of the dead, was the firſt in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant) would be excluded the Covenant: We finde in the Goſpel, that ſick perſons, that were carried by others, were cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon account of their Faith; and Infants brought to Chriſt by others, were actually themſelves bleſſed by him: Therefore vain is that he aſſerts, <hi>that actuall receiving into covenant imports</hi> an offering which is to be done by profeſſion; as if more were to be required for admiſſion of viſible members into covenant, than was for admiſſion, or actuall receiving of Chriſt as God-man, and Mediator to be viſible head of the Church; for though we read that the Star, and Angels proclaimed him, the wiſe men offered Gold, and Myrrh, and Frankincenſe to him, yet we read not that he made any offering himſelf by profeſſion, till he came of riper years, increaſing in knowledge, and ſtature, and favour with God, and man.</p>
                     <p>The proof of the Minor, that God did promiſe to <hi>Abraham</hi> that Infants ſhould be in covenant under the Goſpel, taken from <hi>Geneſ. 17. 7.

In which text three things are obſervable. 1. That the Scripture foretold that God would juſtify the heathen through faith, that is the partition wall ſhould be pulled down, and the heathen nations ſhould profeſs faith as viſible members, whereof ſome ſhould be actually juſtified as members inviſible. 2. That the ſame Goſpel that was afterwards preached to the heathens, was firſt preached to <hi>Abraham.</hi> 3. That in <hi>Abraham,</hi> that is in him, as the root whence ſprung the branches, or in the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made with him, or in Chriſt virtually in him by way of excellencie, all nations ſhall be bleſſed.

                     <p>The reader muſt be advertiſed, that the true occaſion of my producing that Text was this; when I had proved the covenant God made with <hi>Abraham</hi> was to continue to the end of the world, becauſe it was a Goſpell-covenant. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 8.

To this he now upon ſecond thoughts anſwers, impliedly confesſing, that Infants were then in covenant, but from thence could not be concluded a continuance of covenant to Infants; His exceptions againſt it are four.

                        </gap>der.</p>
                     <p>His firſt exception, that the ſpeech is onely of a tranſient fact, is confuted by many Arguments rivitted in the text: Ile inſiſt in one or two, ver. 10. 11. <hi>little ones are ſaid to ſtand before the Lord, to enter into covenant with him,</hi> what covenant was this? ver. 25. That which he made with them, when he brought them out of the land of <hi>Egypt;</hi> This covenant was perpetuall to all, and binding all, even children, and to put this out of all controverſie, he addes in the 29. that thoſe things that are revealed (meaning concerning
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:45475:77"/> this covenant) belongs unto us, and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this Law; That which is for ever is no Tranſient fact.</p>
                     <p>His ſecond excepion is, <hi>That it is not of a command.</hi> No? does not the Chapter begin thus? <hi>Theſe are the words of the Covenant, which the Lord</hi> commanded Moſes <hi>to make with the children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>in the land of</hi> Moab. 29. <hi>Thoſe things revealed unto them, and their children, that they may do all the words of this Law.</hi> Now a law is a command, or a precept of doing, or avoiding ſome thing <hi>v.</hi> 23. God threatens that for breach of this Covenant, the whole land ſhall be brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, and ſalt, and burning, that it ſhall not be ſowen, nor any graſſe grow therein, like the overthrow of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah, Admah,</hi> and <hi>Zeboim</hi> which the Lord overthrew in his anger: Now every puniſhment preſuppoſeth the breach of a law, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry law a command, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                        </gap>. And if any ſay this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth not children, let him look back at the command, and curſe, <hi>Circumciſe the foreskin of every male-child, for he that is not circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſhall be cut off, for he hath broke my Covenant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His third exception, <hi>that it is not a promiſe of ſomething perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally future</hi> is overthrown, in that it is ſaid, 29. that it is revealed to them, and their children for ever; and 13. that the end of the Covenant is, that God may eſtabliſh them a people unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and that he may be a God unto them; but God is no leſſe a God to Infants under the Goſpel, than under the Law. And to affirm that Infants ſtood once in Covenant before the Lord, and ſhall not do ſo ſtill, is but a begging of the Queſtion; for they cannot ſhew a line in Scripture where the priviledge is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked, or repealed; the contrary may be proved by unanſwerable arguments.</p>
                     <p>His fourth exception is, <hi>that what is ſaid of the little ones, is as well ſaid of wives, hewers of wood, drawers of water, and therefore if thence be concluded a continuance of Covenant to Infants, a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of covenant to wives, and ſervants will be concluded;</hi> what Inconvenience? As hewers of wood, drawers of water, wives, ſervants, if profeſſors, or proſelytes were in Covenant under the law, even ſo believing wives, and ſervants under the Goſpel are in Covenant: Hence we may retort, If wives, and ſervants are in covenant under the Goſpell, as well as under the Law; then by his own conceſſion it may be concluded, that Infants are in covenant under the Goſpell, but wives, and ſervants are in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant as well under the Goſpell, as under the Law, Therefore Infants are in Covenant under the Goſpell; and to this fair iſſue the matter is come.</p>

                     <p>THough Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> could not make his retreat good, nor man his fort conſiſting of a fourfold exception; yet like as <hi>Thuci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dides</hi> ſaid of <hi>Pericles,</hi> when he was asked by <hi>Archidamus</hi> King of the Spartans, whether he, or his adverſary wraſtled better? A man (ſaith he) cannot tell, for when I caſt him down, he by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he hath no fall, perſwadeth the beholders, and ſo overco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth: So he being beat out of his holds, peremptorily held his concluſion, maugre the premiſſes, that the covenant was not perpetual, and as well to Infants under the Goſpell, as under the Law: Againſt which was concluded thus. If Chriſt hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a more excellent Miniſtery, and is a Mediator of a better covenant, which is eſtabliſhed upon better promiſes, than if In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants were in covenant under the Law, they are in covenant under the Goſpel; But <hi>Heb. 7. 22. 8. 6. Chriſt hath obtained a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Miniſtery, was a Mediator of a better Covenant, which was establiſhed upon better promiſes;</hi> Therefore if Infants were in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant under the Law, they are in covenant under the Goſpell. This he ſayes is a vain allegation, implyedly denying the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the Major, and gives his reaſons; 1. negatively, that the meliority of the covenant is not placed in the extent to the ſort of perſons, for then it ſhould be extended to more ſorts than the covenant of the Law was; 2. affirmatively, But to the meliority of the promiſes, which were of better things, or better terms than the promiſes of the Law: Thence he infers, that not to any other
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:45475:78"/> but the elect, and true believers, and ſo not to Infants as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall ſeed of believers. Theſe are either wild aſſertions, or incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent deductions which now comes to the touch-ſtone:</p>
                     <p>Firſt he affirms that the meliority of the covenant is not placed ſin the extent to the ſort of perſons, what then? will it follow if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>erogatives may be greater than of the Law, and yet equally to profeſſors, and their children. We argue not affirmatively, it is a better covenant, becauſe it is made to more than before; but nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, it were not a better covenant, at leaſt <hi>eatenus</hi> if it were not made to all it was before. But as his inference, ſo his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is falſe, for the Meliority (to uſe his barbariſm) of the covenant is alſo placed in the extent to the ſort of perſons; for whereas before it was confined onely to the Jews, now all Nations, Jews, Gentiles, Grecians, Barbarians, bond, free flows in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2. 2. as we have a <hi>praeludium</hi> of it <hi>Acts 2. 9. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chians,</hi> and <hi>Medes, Elamites,</hi> and the dwellers in <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> and in <hi>Judea,</hi> and <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> in <hi>Pontus,</hi> and <hi>Aſia, Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,</hi> and <hi>Pamphylia,</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the parts of <hi>Lybia,</hi> about <hi>Cyrene,</hi> and ſtrangers of <hi>Rome, Cretes,</hi> and <hi>Arabians,</hi> the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull works of God. By this you ſee his reaſon is turned point blank againſt himſelf, and the contradictory of his propoſitions are true; The Meliority of the covenant is placed in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to the ſort of perſons, becauſe it is extended to more ſorts, than the covenant of the Law was: And this in anſwer to his negative proofs. The affirmative follow, which are theſe. 1. That the Meliority of the covenant is placed in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liority of the promiſes. 2. That Goſpel-promiſes are of better things, or better terms than the promiſes of the Law. 3. That the promiſes of the Goſpel are not to any other, than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, and true believers, and therefore not to Infants as the naturall ſeed of believers; for the firſt, that the Meliority of the covenant is placed in the Meliority of the promiſes is both im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent, and untrue. Impertinent, for if it were confeſſed that the Meliority of the covenant is placed in the Meliority of the promiſes, it will not follow that Infants are not in covenant as well under the Goſpell, as under the Law; nor will it avoid
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:45475:78"/> my Argument, unleſſe it were with a term of excluſion, that the betterneſs of the Covenant is only placed in the Meliority of of the promiſes, which he aſſerts not, for it may be alſo pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in other things, as in a larger extent to perſons in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, beſides the forementioned, even to Infants before eight days old: Neither will the preheminence of circumſtances (wherein the dignity of the Covenant under the Goſpell, and under the Law is diſtinguiſhed) countervaile the holding out of one ſoul out of Covenant, and ſo ordinary capacity of ſalvation, much more, ſo many millions of Infants that dy before they be actual profeſſors.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo untrue that the meliority of the Covenant is placed in the meliority of the promiſes; as if better things in ſubſtance were promiſed under the Goſpell, than under the Law; or as if the promiſes under the Goſpell, and under the Law were not in effect the ſame, differing onely in Oeconomies, and ſeveral man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of adminiſtration; the contrary of which is Anti-nomianiſm.</p>
                     <p>His ſecond Theſis is, that Goſpell-promiſes are of better things than the promiſes of the Law, which would imply that there were ſalvation in ſome other name, than in the name of Jeſus, and that Jeſus Chriſt were not the ſame to day, yeſterday, and for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. True it is Chriſt was not at all times revealed alike clearly, obſcurely to <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſeed of the woman that ſhould bruiſe the Serpents head; to <hi>Abraham</hi> more fully, that in his ſeed all the Nations of the Earth ſhould be bleſſed; To <hi>Moſes</hi> in Types<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadowes, ſacrifices; really in the fleſh of the virgin; ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by the Holy Ghoſt after the aſſention: But before the Law, under the Law, and under the Goſpell, Chriſt was the merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious cauſe, grace was the means, glory was the end of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, the Identity of which, makes the Identity of the thing promiſed.</p>
                     <p>His third Paradox is, that the promiſes of the Goſpel are not to any others than the elect, and true believers; here we muſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh, The promiſes of the Goſpel are twofold, either inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and ſpiritual, or external, and of Ordinances: Interna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> again, are either hypothetical, and conditional, or categorical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and abſolute: Hence ariſes theſe three propoſitions. 1. That the external promiſes of the Goſpell, which are of ordinances, are made to all viſible members. 2. That the internal, and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al promiſes of the Goſpel are made, or propounded conditionally to all viſible members; hence aroſe thoſe diſtinctions of <hi>Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcen</hi> and others, <hi>Signi,</hi> and <hi>bene placiti; ſufficienter,</hi> and <hi>efficienter,

                     </p>
                     <p>3. That the internal, and ſpiritual promiſes of the Goſpel are made abſolutely, and terminated or performed onely to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, and inviſible members <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Here it is apparent that his allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is onely true in the third ſenſe, in the two former manifeſtly falſe; in which ſenſe onely it concerns our preſent controverſie of viſible Church memberſhip: And how his aſſertion makes for him, nay, not directly againſt him, I cannot ſee; for the meli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority of the covenant conſiſts principally in outward Ordinances, manner of adminiſtration, and diſpenſation; extent and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plitude of the propoſal; not of grace and glory, of which there was alwayes the ſame reaſon; <hi>Enoch, Abraham, Eliah</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> were as well juſtified by faith, and had a reſpect to the recompence of reward, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. as well as <hi>Peter</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles.</p>
                     <p>His laſt aſſertion is, <hi>That becauſe the promiſes of the Goſpell are not to any other than the Elect, and true believers, therefore they are not to Infants, as the natural ſeed of believers:</hi> The Antecedent is proved to be falſe, for though the ſpiritual part of Goſpel-promiſes is abſolutely performed, and terminated to the Elect, yet they are conditionally propoſed to all profeſſors; and the externall part which conſiſts in adminiſtration of Ordinances is equally belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto all viſible members. His conſequent is alſo unſound, for the internal and ſpiritual part may be made intentionally to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, as the ſpiritual ſeed of believers, and yet the external part, and that of Ordinances to Infants as the natural ſeed of believers, as well under the Goſpel, as under the Law: That under the Law it is apparent by the Hiſtory of the Old Teſtament, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by that of <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

Then he gave no direct anſwer, but now ſayes, if I mean by Chriſtendome all that are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called Chriſtians, he grants it, this is his conceſſion, but with two limitations, 1. If the Infants be the one half of them, 2. If their unchurching be in reſpect of viſible Church-memberſhip, but then he counts it no abſurdity, there is his Epanorthoſis, or correction. Again he ſayes that he knowes not what ordinary means of ſalvation, I conceive they are left without, except Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, which he takes not to be an ordinary means of ſalvation, and therefore thinks it no inconvenience to ſay that Infants are without ordinary means of Salvation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet are ſaved by the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of God, redemption of Chriſt, and works of his ſpirit, All this being ſummed together is in his ſenſe to deny the major, and interpretatively averrs, That which unchurches the one half of Chriſtendome, and leaves them no ordinary means of ſalvation, may be a better Covenant; Ile trace him in his own foot ſteps.</p>
                     <p>Firſt to gratifie him, I mean by Chriſtendome all that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called Chriſtians; that is them, and their children that hold the fundamentals, till they deny them by their life, or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and then too, ſo far, that after repentance they are not to be baptized again, or readmitted by iteration of the ſeal, contrary to <hi>Cyprian,</hi> the Novatians, and Donatiſts, with the Councell of <hi>Carthage.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. I conceive that Infants, that is (beſides thoſe that dye in their mothers wombes) they that expire before, and after Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm before years of diſcretion, with the number of thoſe that lives before the dippers will admit them to their water-ordinance,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:45475:80"/> are the one half, if not the greater of viſible members, as by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining of Regiſters hath been obſerved.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly I grant him that their unchurching is in reſpect of viſible Church memberſhip, though not onely ſo, but of inviſible Church-memberſhip, alſo interpretatively, and conſequently<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for they that are not in covenant, and members of the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible, have no promiſe, no preſent hope of Salvation <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 12. This he ſeems to overthrow by theſe poſitions following<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. That he knowes not what ordinary means of Salvation Infants out of Covenant are left without except baptiſm; 2. That he takes not Baptiſm to be an ordinary means of Salvation without faith. 3. He thinks it no inconvenience to ſay that Infants are without ordinary means of Salvation. 4. That Infants are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the election of God, redemption of Chriſt, and work of his ſpirit, without ordinary means; Theſe are his ſlight works, that he intends to entrench himſelf in, but (God willing) we ſhall eaſily levell them.</p>
                     <p>Firſt he ſayes, that he knowes not what ordinary means of Salvation Infants out of Covenant are left without, except Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; And is not that enough? An Infant under the Law, left without any ordinary means of ſalvation, ſave onely circumciſion was in a ſad condition, ſeeing God ſaid <hi>Gen. 17. 14. The uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed Manchild, whoſe fleſh of his foreskin is not circumciſed, that ſoul ſhall be cut off from his people, for he hath broken my Covenant;</hi> and ſhall we not think the condition as bad of an Infant under the Goſpell, left without any ordinary means of ſalvation, ſave onely Baptiſm, ſeeing Chriſt ſayes, <hi>John 3. 5.

Or thoſe thing, that are neither in
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:45475:81"/> our power, nor others, performed neither by our ſelves, nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, yet by Gods free Charter in our ſelves, and others; Thus covenant-holineſs, prerogative of birth, Gods promiſe to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> that he would be his God, and the God of his ſeed; That of <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 2. 39. confirmed to Jewes and Gentiles, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is to you and your children are ordinary means of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Infants out of covenant are left without all theſe, and would be in the ſame condition with Gentiles, <hi>Epheſ. 2. 12. Without Chriſt, Aliens from the Commonwealth of Iſrael, ſtrangers from the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonant of promiſe, having no hope, and without God in the World;</hi> Thus negatively what they are deprived of by being out of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. Let us ſee poſitively the benefits of being in covenant by comparing them with Jewes children with whom they hold pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 12. What advantage hath the Jew, or what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit is there of Circumciſion? Much every way; chiefly becauſe unto them were committed the Oracles of God. And <hi>Rom. 9 4. Who are Iſraelites, to whom pertaineth the Adoption, and the Covenants, and the giving of the Law, and the ſervice of God, and the promiſes;</hi> there is the ſame reaſon of Infants under the Goſpell.</p>
                     <p>Secondly he ſayes, that he takes not Baptiſm to be any ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry means of ſalvation without faith; what he takes is not much material, ſo long as he miſtakes: If it be an ordinary means of ſalvation any way, it is enough to prove that Infants are left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that means; And in this his amphibological aſſeveration are cooped three fallacies, 1. <hi>Fallacia diviſionis,</hi> for the Queſtion is not whether Baptiſm be an ordinary means of ſalvation without faith, but whether it be a means or no; 2. <hi>A dicto ſimpliciter ad dictum ſecundùm quid,</hi> for the Queſtion is not whether Baptiſm be a principle means, but whether it be a means, 3. <hi>Non cauſae ut cauſae.</hi> For it is not enquired whether baptiſm preſuppoſes faith as a cauſe or qualification, but whether Baptiſm be the ordinary way God hath appointed for ſalvation: And when the propoſal is whether baptiſm be an ordinary means of Salvation? To ſay it is not without faith, is as unſavory, as when the demand is, whether the lungs are an ordinary Inſtrument of breathing, to ſay they are not without the heart; when the Queſtion is ſimply whether a Colonel hath any command in an Army? It would be ridiculous to anſwer it by ſaying he hath none without orders from the General; And yet there is not that neceſſary connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt faith, and Baptiſm, that is betwixt the lungs, and the heart; for the lungs cannot breath without the heart, nor the Colonel iſſue out any word of command without ſubordination
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:45475:81"/> to his generall: But Baptiſm may be true Baptiſm even in <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultis,</hi> as <hi>Hymenaeus,</hi> without true faith, and many other hypocrites who when they became true Penetentiaries, none but thoſe He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, the Novations, and Donatiſts, durſt Baptize again, But for the Baptiſm of Infants, actuall faith is not neceſſarie for the <hi>bene eſſe,</hi> or perfection of it, much leſs for the <hi>eſſe</hi> or being of it: And that they have the infuſed habit of faith, or the roots, and ſeeds of it, he confeſſes ſaying, they are ſaved by the work of Chriſt's ſpirit, which can be no other, but the ſeeds of faith, hope, charitie, and the new creature.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, he thinks it no inconvenience to ſay that Infants are without ordinary means of ſalvation: he means preaching of the word, for ſo he expreſſeth himſelf: of that we muſt diſtinguiſh, Preaching is either, manifeſting to the underſtanding that which is preached, ſo Infants are without the means; or preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting objectively the benefit of that which is preached, as the new creature, gifts of the ſpirit, ſalvation, ſo Infants are not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the means: A will is ſealed, and publiſhed by the Father <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Laſtly he ſayes Infants are ſaved by the election of God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Chriſt, and work of his ſpirit without ordinary means; This implyes a contradiction, of which his forge is full; for if God hath revealed in the Covenant of the Goſpell, and made a promiſe thereof, that Infants are ſaved by the election of God, redemption of Chriſt, and work of his ſpirit, then it is not without ordinary means, for this is the way that God hath declared himſelf ordinarily to operate in, whoſe will is a fix<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Or how dare he avouch it? God hath promiſed no ſuch thing to Infants of Jews, Turks, Infidels, therefore they are out of Covenant, and not viſible member<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>: if God hath promiſed ſuch things to Infants of believers, they are in Covenant, and viſible members. But perhaps he means In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are ſaved without ordinary means, that is baptiſm: That if
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:45475:82"/> it were true, might vindicate <hi>a tanto,</hi> that they are ſaved without that ordinary means, but not <hi>a toto,</hi> that they are ſaved without an ordinary means. But his former grant neceſſarily infers that they are not ſaved without Baptiſm, for <hi>what can forbid water</hi> (ſayes the Apoſtle) <hi>that theſe may not be baptized, ſeeing they have recieved the Holy Ghoſt as well as we:</hi> Now they that have elections redemption of Chriſt, and work of his ſpirit, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Holy Ghoſt; which is a thing ſo clear that Mr. <hi>T.</hi> himſelf is forced to confeſs, that if he knew Infants were elected, he would Baptize them; and here he acknowledges of the ſpecies, or ſort of believers Infants, that they are not only elected of God, but redeemed of Chriſt, and have the work of his ſpirit; And why then they may not be baptized, even from his own grounds, is paſt my underſtanding to apprehend. Now to return to the Argument, and ſumme up all, That which deprives the one half of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of ſubſtantials, as the benefit of the word, inward, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward baptiſm, viſible Church memberſhip, Prerogative of birth, covenant-holyneſs, Gods promiſe of grace, and glory, cannot be a better covenant than that which differed onely in circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials, and deprived of none of theſe, but to deny Infants to be in covenant, deprives the one half of Chriſtendome of ſubſtantials, as the benefit of the word, inward and outward Baptiſm, viſible Church memberſhip, Prerogative of Birth, covenant-holyneſs, Gods promiſe of grace, and glorie; Therefore it cannot be a better covenant than that which differed onely in circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials, and deprived of none of theſe.</p>

                     <p>HAving diſpatched the firſt branch of the firſt Argument, that God did promiſe before the Law, that Infants ſhould be actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally received into Covenant under the Goſpel, Mr. <hi>T.</hi> forgetting the office of a reſpondent, went about authoritatively to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Queſtion, till with much importunity he was perſwaded to attend the proof of the ſecond branch, to wit, that God fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told under the Law, that Infants ſhould be actually received into Covenant, or be Church-members under the Goſpel, which was done by this medium. He that foretold that he would lift up his hand to the Gentiles, and ſet up a ſtandard to the people, and that they ſhould bring their ſons in their arms, and their daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſhould be carried upon their ſhoulders, foretold that Infants ſhould be Church-members under the Goſpel; But thus ſaith the Lord God, <hi>Iſai, 49 22. Behold I will lift up my hand to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, and ſet up my standard to the people, they ſhall bring thy ſons in their arms, and thy daughters ſhall be carried upon their ſhoulders;</hi> Therefore God foretold that Infants ſhould be Church-members under the Goſpel. Then he denyed the major, ſaying the meaning was that the Jews ſhould bring the Gentiles children, to which was reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, God ſayes I will lift up my hand to the Gentiles, and they that is the Gentiles ſhall bring thy ſons, and Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſayes the Jewes ſhall bring thy ſons, whereupon the words were read, ſo that he recollecting himſelf, ſaid the meaning was, the Gentiles ſhould bring the Jews children from captivity, and that it d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But how proves he that it is a propheſie, that the Gentilds ſhould bring back the Jewes, not onely Infants, but others from captivity? Two wayes, Firſt by Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

The meaning of Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> is true, But it is the meaning of Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> that many Texts in Scripture concludes for Infant-Baptiſm, Therefore that many Texts in Scripture concludes for Infant-Baptiſm, is true.

But that the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was not that the Gentiles ſhould bring the Jews Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren from Captivitie, I urged from the Contents of the Chapter, Which though no demonſtrative Argument, yet far more concluding than his, that was but drawn from a ſingle Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie, The contents are theſe, Chriſt ſent to the Jews, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth of them to the 5. verſe, he is ſent to the Gentiles with gracious promiſes. 13.

                     <p>Secondly he affirms that there is in the Contents of the Chapter not any thing to the contrarie, but that is was a prophecie that the Gentiles ſhould bring the Jews from captivity: from captivity? when? At their recalling at, or near the end of the world to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Goſpel? That may agree with analogie of faith, but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the meaning of the place, nor his purpoſe; The Contents begin thus: Chriſt being ſent to the Jews complaineth of them, ſent to his own after the Incarnation, and they knew him not, complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of them, becauſe his Goſpel was a ſtumbling block to them: Now to revolve this back to the reducing from captivity would be a ſtrange Anachroniſm, for the captivity was many hundred years before the Incarnation; from the captivity the Perſian Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the <hi>Maccabees</hi> 127. after that Chriſt was born in the 30. year of the reign of <hi>Herod</hi> the great, verſe 5. he is ſent to the Gentiles with a gracious promiſe according to <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 40. The promiſe is to you, and your Children, if you embrace it, and to them that are afar off, even the Gentiles, when God ſhall call them: which <hi>Cyprian de duplici Martyrio</hi> confirms, <hi>ecce â Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni redemptoris temporibus anni effluxerunt plus minus 240. jam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que hujus vitis palmites latius ſe ſparſerunt, quam Romanum Imperium,</hi> It is little more or leſs (ſaith he) then two hundred and fortie yeares ſince the dayes of Chriſt, the Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and yet in that time the Church hath ſpread out her branches larger than the Roman Empire; <hi>&amp; quos nulla vis ferri
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:45475:91"/> domare potuit, emollit ſanguis agni candidi,</hi> and they whom no power of the ſword was able to daunt, are made peaceable, and tame by the blood of the unſpotted Lamb. Now to recapitulate this; That which makes for the rejection of the Jews after the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation and calling of the Gentiles, hath ſomething to the contrary, that it was not a prophecie that the Gentiles ſhould bring the Jews Children from Babyloniſh Captivity; There is ſomething in the Contents that makes for the rejection of the Jews after the Incarnation and calling of the Gentiles; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Contents of the Chapter have ſomething to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, that it was not a prophecie that the Gentiles ſhould bring the Jews Children from Captivity.</p>
                     <p>His third allegation is, that the words [18. the ample reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church, 24. the powerfull deliverance out of captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty] do rather confirm that there is ſomething in the Contents of the Chapter, that the Gentiles ſhould bring the Jews Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren from Captivity; We ſhall ſee that by framing it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> into an Argument. The ample reſtauration of the Church, the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full deliverance out of Captivitie is promiſed, therefore there is ſomething in the Contents that the Gentiles ſhould bring the Jews from Captivity. I deny the conſequent, for that ample re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration of the Church is meant of the Gentiles graffed into the ſtock of the Jews broken off; That powerfull deliverance out of Captivity, is that which was effected by preaching of the word in the evidence, and demonſtration of the ſpirit, and power, when the Gentiles were delivered from the Captivity of ſin, Satan, and heathen Idols; and this is very clear compared with the former, and his conſequent ſo irrationall, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the diſpute laughed at it, in which he ſays now they ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their ignorance. As I did not then, neither do I now approve of their laughing, yet I think he cannot prove they ſhewed their ignorance, unleſs in this practicall Axiome, that errours are rather to be pittyed in brethern then laughed at. But if he means they ſhewed their ignorance in not underſtanding his conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, I muſt profeſs my ſelf to be amongſt thoſe ignorant, and ſo I believe will the moſt that hears it, in which he will as ſoon perſwade any rationall man, as <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> that the ſnow is black.</p>
                     <p>But he hath alſo a ſnatch at me, ſaying that I ſhewed my heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs when I ſaid it was an Addition to the Text, that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles ſhould bring the Jews: well, let that be examined; An ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition may be two wayes, either in words, ſo it is apparent, for the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:45475:91"/> Text ſays, not that the Gentiles ſhall bring the Jews: Or in ſenſe, and ſo it is not ſaid the Gentiles ſhall bring thy Children by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall generation (which I conceive is the Queſtion) but their own; But he ſayes the very diſtinction of [thy Children] from [the Gentiles] ſhews it meant of the Jews, otherwiſe it ſhould have been [their Children] in the third perſon, not [thine] in the ſecond; here is <hi>vindice cuneo nodus digniſſimus,</hi> a knot that one may unty with his gloves on; They, the Gentiless ſhall bring thy ſons, that is Sons of the Church, and yet the Gentiles Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. But who ever interpreted it thus? A great writer. 1. <hi>Tombs B.</hi> D. in his Plea for Antidaedobaptiſts <hi>pag.</hi> 14. for theſe are his words; The Church is ſpoken to, obſerve not [the Jews,] and the Children were both the Gentiles Children, and yet [thy Children] that is the Churches; Now who ſhewed his heedleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? But in the ſame blindfold poſture he goes on, ſaying it can not be meant of Gods Children as his, for then it ſhould be [mine] in the firſt perſon, for God ſpeaks thoſe words: Here is an Excellent Grammar-lecture of the diſtinction of perſons, for which the Author merits to be <hi>Terrae filius,</hi> the next year; But let us look back? It cannot be meant of Gods Children (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But we might have ſpared our labour all this while; for he denyes not but the words may be accommodated to the times of the Goſpel, This is ſomething that he is contented with the Adulterous woman that the Child ſhall be divided, and we ſhall have part; but the true Mother will either have all, or none.

                     <p>The laſt of the three Queries remaines, which is, whether In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of Believers be Diſciples?

If then all nations in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude every part, nations are not taken Synecdochically for the Diſciples of all nations, Infants of believers are Diſciples, it ſtill remaines a truth, that Infants are not excepted from baptiſm; Which was thus further proved, if Infants be excepted from baptiſm, it is either becauſe they are not named in the text, or becauſe we find no inſtance that any were baptized, or becauſe
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:45475:102"/> they are not capable, but for none of theſe three, therefore In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are not excepted. In the conference Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> denyed the Major, ſaying that a fourth reaſon might be given, becauſe they were not Diſciples, whereupon I told him that in this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer he ſhewed himſelf no good Logician, for it is an Axiom, that in no diviſion, one member can be affirmed of another, becauſe they are oppoſite; Now to be Diſciples, and capable of Baptiſm were not oppoſite, but ſubordinate; and to be Diſciples, if it made them not capable it was no exception at all; if it made them capable, it was the ſame with the third; To which Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma he gave them no direct anſwer, nor does yet, ſave that he ſayes, for my diviſion he gave the genuine reaſon why Infants are excepted from the precept of baptizing, becauſe they are no Diſciples, and that there was no defect in his Log<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>That he gave not the genuine reaſon why Infants were excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the precept of baptizing appears by the falſity of his antecedent, and conſequent too, if underſtood of Diſciples actual believers; and that there was a palpable defect in his Logick, in not reducing it to one of my members, is manifeſt from the lawes of a true diviſion, 1.

                        </gap>, 2. The parts were adequate, and even with the whole, for every thing that may be preſumed to hinder from Baptiſm, is either becauſe they are not named in the precept, or becauſe there is no inſtance in Scripture thereof, or becauſe they are not capable thereof, Incapacity includes all imaginary impediments beſides the other two; he inartificially addes a fourth, which is inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the former, for to be Diſciples renders capable of baptiſm in his ſenſe, if not capable, it can be avouched in no ſenſe; To this he ſayes <hi>capable of Baptiſm</hi> and <hi>Diſciples</hi> are not terms ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate, but diſtinct without oppoſition; Prodigious: not terms ſubordinate, and yet predicated one of another? But diſtinct without oppoſition, ſo we yield; the genus is predicated of his ſpecies is formally diſtinguiſhed from it, without oppoſition, But how can this be a diſtinct member from the reſt, that is not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed? <hi>Membra dividentia debent eſſe oppoſita:</hi> And that capable of baptizing is predicated of Diſciples he grants, ſaying, though to be Diſciples made them capable; but thinks to relieve himſelf by ſaying there is a difference between the terms; if by diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence he mean <hi>diſtinctio formalis</hi> I grant it, but that overthrowes his poſition, that they are ſubordinate; if by difference he means
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:45475:102"/> they are <hi>diſparata</hi> then one cannot be predicated of the other, which he allowes.</p>
                     <p>But he concludes from a ſuppoſed conceſſion of mine, ſaying he preſumes I think baptized perſons already Diſciples, yet not capable of baptiſm; It is but his preſumption, for though I think baptized perſons already Diſciples, yet capable of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm not in his ſenſe that they may be rebaptized or <hi>toties quoties</hi> dipped, for that is <hi>per accidens,</hi> becauſe Baptiſm is a Sacrament that is not reiterable, but becauſe they are qualified for baptiſm in <hi>ſpecie</hi> indeterminately, and the contrary to his aſſertion is true; As a man that is regenerate, is therefore capable of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, as being elected, and otherwiſe qualified for it, which remains after regeneration; So Diſciples baptized are therefore ſtill capable of baptiſm, becauſe they have the qualification, or fundament of the ſacred relation ſtill adhaering, or inhaering <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Phariſees ſaying, that it was needfull to Circumciſe them, but they upon whom the yoke was to be impoſed by Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion were onely Infants among the Jews, and Infants together with Parents amongſt the Gentiles, Therefore many of them were Infants. The Major was proved that the yoke was Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion by comparing the 5. and 10. with the foregoing verſes. 1. verſe, <hi>Certain men came down from</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and taught the brethren, except ye be Circumciſed after the manner of</hi> Moſes, <hi>ye cannot be ſaved;</hi> where obſerve that Circumciſion is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Queſtion, In the ſecond verſe they determined that <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and certain others of them ſhould go to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> unto the Apoſtles, and Elders about this Queſtion, to wit, Circumciſion. In the 5. ver. <hi>Certain of the ſect of the Phariſees ſaid that it was needfull to Circumciſe them;</hi> In the 6. <hi>The Apostles came together to conſider of the matter,</hi> that is Circumciſion; And when there had been much diſputing <hi>Peter</hi> aroſe up in the 7. and determined the Queſtion in the tenth verſe, <hi>Why tempt ye God to put a yoke upon the neck</hi>
                        <pb n="190" facs="tcp:45475:104"/> of the Diſciples? Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his anſwer to all this is, that it is fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous; of which contumelious cenſure, I am ſure his pretended reaſon is guilty, for ſayes he, though ver. 1. 5. there is mention of Circumciſion, yet not of Circumciſion as acted on Infants, but taught brethren: Here are two queſtions, The firſt is negative, that there is not mention of Circumciſion as acted on Infants; The ſecond affirmative, That it is Circumciſion as acted onely on brethren: Ile invert the order, and begin with the latter. That which is preſſed as a Tranſient act, and not permanent to poſterity, is not mentioned here: But Circumciſion acted onely on taught brethren is preſſed onely as a Tranſlent act, not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent to poſterity, Therefore Circumciſion acted onely on taught brethren is not mentioned here. The Major is apparent, becauſe they that came from <hi>Judea</hi> did not preſs a duty that ſhould determine preſently, but to continue alwaies to poſterity, of which nature in their Judgement was circumciſion, and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to <hi>Moſes</hi> his law: Therefore the determination of the Councell againſt them <hi>v.</hi> 28. was not a Tranſient, but a permanent decree binding negatively from circumciſion all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants for the time to come. The Minor is as clear, That circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion acted on taught bretheren, not Infants, had been a Tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent act, would have expired with that generation, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned their Infants to poſterity, and according to his ground the Councell had determined nothing againſt Infant-circumciſion which nevertheleſſe would have been ſtill in force, provided they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>His ſecond evaſion is that there is no mention of Circumciſion as acted on Infants, The falſity of which appears by this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; If it were Infants alſo whom the falſe teachers would have had to be Circumciſed as neceſſary, and as engaging to <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, then mention is made of Circumciſion, as acted, (or to be acted) on Infants, But it was Infants alſo whom the falſe teachers would have had to be Circumciſed as neceſſary, and as engaging unto <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, Therefore mention is made of Circumciſion as acted (or to be acted) on Infants. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent (to wit) it was Infants alſo they would have Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, is cleared ver. 1. <hi>Except ye be Circumciſed after the manner of</hi> Moſes, <hi>ye cannot be ſaved,</hi> if they would have had them Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed after the manner of <hi>Moſes,</hi> then they would have In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants alſo Circumciſed, But they would hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But it will be expected I ſhould make good the Conſequence, which in the words following he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretatively denyes, ſaying when the Apoſtles ver. 6. did conſider of the matter, they did not conſider of the circumciſion as acted, but taught, and not onely of Circumciſion, but alſo impoſing the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> as neceſſary, which was the putting the yeake <hi>ver.</hi> 10. To which ſaying of Mr. <hi>T.</hi> I will oppoſe Mr. <hi>T. his own words</hi> Exam. <hi>pag.</hi> 101. Now I pray you (ſayes he) what is this yoke <hi>Acts.</hi> 15. 10. but circumciſion? as if he ſhould ſay with an Emphaſis, it is nothing elſe; and here he ſays it is not circumciſion as acted, but the doctrin, and the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> The Satyr will be affraid of converſing with him, that can blow hot, and cold, contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries out of the ſame mouth.</p>
                     <p>But that it was Circumciſion as acted I ſhall (God willing) cleer out of the Text, where it is in plain terms thrice ſet down, ver. 1. They taught the Brethren except ye be Circumciſed after the manner of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ye cannot be ſaved; he does not ſay, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ye be taught Circumciſion, and ſo have the Theory ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically without the practice, but paſſively except ye be Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, and have the ſeal cut in your fleſh, and that after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Moſes,</hi> who did uſually Circumciſe Males at eight days old, and for neglecting but one, the Lord would have ſlain him. And ver. 5. They taught it was needfull to Circumciſe them, not needfull to teach them the Law of Circumciſion, but to act it upon them, and in them, And ver. 24. Ye muſt be Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, not taught Circumciſion; And though from this yoke, (taking it <hi>aggregativè</hi>) we neither exclude teaching, nor the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> yet to ſay that they did not conſider Circumciſion as acted is a groſs abſurdity, and a giving the Holy Ghoſt the lye, as appears in the three former Texts, teaching was the means by which the falſe brethren preſſed actuall Circumciſion as a ſeal obligatory to the neceſſary obſervation of the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Theſe three are linked together which he fallaciouſly divides; Therefore it is a moſt ridiculous ſaying of his to ſay it is ridiculous to conceive that thoſe teachers mentioned ver. 1. did attempt to do any thing to Infants, when the attempt is ſaid thrice to be actuall Circumciſion, and it is moſt certain that theſe men coming from <hi>Judea</hi> did act it onely upon their own Children at home, preſſed it according to the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> (for it is called his Law, becauſe he both penned it, as the whole</p>

If they were by diſpoſition, how were they not by inward aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent? I anſwer as the body by organization is diſpoſed before to receive the forme, ſo poſſibly they had previous diſpoſitions fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners of actual faith, This all of them at the leaſt had, and probably many of them had more; therefore I ſay perhaps not by outward aſſent, and habit, not denying but that perhaps al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by inward aſſent, and habit; for indefinite propoſitions in a contingent matter, and particulars in divers Subjects, though ſeeming oppoſite, may be both true: Some of theſe to whom the Apoſtles ſpoke, might be believers onely by outward aſſent, and diſpoſition, others by inward aſſent, and habit.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Quere is, how I know they were believers by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward aſſent, and not by inward? I anſwer by many circumſtances in the Text, which evidently clears that thus far at the leaſt, they were prediſpoſed for actual faith; but that they had not actual faith with inward aſſent, I dare not take upon me, with him to know, who peremptorily ſayes they were not yet believers, and that my words, if he had faithfully recited them, had diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, for I ſaid perhaps they were not believers by outward aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, The word [<hi>perhaps</hi>] left out would have anſwered the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion;
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:45475:107"/> and his Subquere in the cloaſe is as irrational, where he demands, do I know they were hypocrites? Which cannot be preſumed of me, who knowes nothing to the contrary, but that ſome of them, at the leaſt, had true faith, and if they had not, it doth not follow they were hypocrites, much leſſe that I ſhould know them ſo; for they might have previous diſpoſitions to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, and the new creature without juſtifying faith, and yet no hypocrites He might have learned ſo much from <hi>Aristotle, lib.

                     <p>The third Quere is, what act did they ſhew, which expreſſed outward aſſent to the acknowlegment of Chriſt as their Lord? Which Queſtion I anſwer with another Queſtion; what act did the reſt of the houſhold of <hi>Lydia</hi> ſhew, which expreſſed outward aſſent to the acknowledgment of Chriſt as their Lord before they were baptized? I know Mr. <hi>T..</hi> will not ſay none, for that croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth both his principles and ours, who both acknowledge in them of years, there muſt be ſome outward aſſent, but he knowes Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſilent of any <hi>Acts,</hi> 16. 15. and why might it not as well be ſilent alſo? But if he here muſt have acts expreſſing outward aſſent to the acknowledgment of Chriſt as their Lord, what can be more ſignal than theſe? After they heard <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Chriſts birth, death, reſurrection, exaltation, ſending of the Holy Ghoſt, and that he whom they crucified, was both Lord and Chriſt, they were pricked in their heart, and ſaid unto <hi>Peter,</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles, <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Brethren what ſhall we do?</hi> 37.

                     <p>TO the Argument, To whom the promiſe of grace belonged, to them baptiſm belongs alſo, but the promiſe of grace belongs to believers, and their Children. <hi>Ergo,</hi> he ſayes he anſwered, (implyedly denying the Major) out of the Text, when they are called, or are believers, not before; which anſwer is abſurd, ſeeing there is no mention in the Text of calling as appliable to theſe Jews, nor of believers at all; or if ſo, they cannot be debarred for want of that qualification they had already. Firſt there is no mention in the Text of calling as applyable to theſe Jews, for the words in their genuine ſenſe ſound thus, The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is [made] to you [Jews] near, and preſent, and your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren you now have,] and to them that are afar off, [diſtant in place, or affection, Jews, or Gentiles] whoſoever they be that the Lord ſhall call [To, or unto him, and unto their Children;] for afar off, and preſent, or near, are here oppoſed as ſaith <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovicm
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:45475:111"/> de Dieu.</hi> Secondly there is no mention in the Text of believers at all; for the words are not believe, and be baptized, <hi>but repent, and be baptized, for the promiſe is to you, and your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;</hi> The former is a corrupting, and this latter is an adding to the Text; Thirdly if there had been mention of believing, and calling applyable to theſe Jews, it had been no debar for want of that qualification they had already; for they were alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy believers in the ſame ſenſe they were Penitentiaries, by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward aſſent, and previous diſpoſitions at leaſt, as is formerly declared, and conſequently called at leaſt with an outward call: Before Chriſts Incarnation the Jews had a call that aſſented to all things that were revealed; after his incarnation, and reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, they continued their call that entertained further Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations, as it is apparent theſe three thouſand d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Does Mr. C. think that the unbelieving Jews had the promiſe? and yet they were in Covenant in his ſenſe before, even the whole Nation; Or doth he think that Christs blood was not avenged on them?

Reaſon dictates the contrarie. His evaſion in the conference, was more colourable, thus. If by bleſſing was meant the Inward, and ſpirituall part of the covenant it might be true, but that was not to the preſent purpoſe, ſeeing it is not known to us; but if the outward, and viſible part, he denyed that Infants were capable of the bleſſing as well as liable to the curſe, which diſtinction was thus taken away; They that are holy with a Covenant ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs are capable of the outward viſible part of the bleſſing, But Infants of believers are holy with a Covenant holineſs, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are capable of the outward, and viſible part. Of this Syllogiſm he ſayes, he might have denyed the Major, Its ſtrange a man ſhould be more abſurd upon deliberation, than on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, as is evident he is by his reaſon, for (ſayes he) there is a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant holineſs according to election, which doth not alwaies inſtate the perſon in that which I call the outward part of the bleſſing, by which I mean title to Baptiſm; what he means by this Centaur of Covenant-holineſs by election is hard to conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, whether of elect Infants before they be born, or of elect Infidels before they be called, or of believers, or unbelievers, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified Infants, before profeſſion.

                     <p>Mine intended brevity will not ſuffer me to give reaſons of this genuine interpretation, onely thus much by the way, that holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is here meant, from which the Jewes were fallen, and the natural branches were broken off, but it was outward covenant holineſs from whence theſe Jewes were fallen, and the natural branches were broken off, Therefore outward Covenant holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is here meant; The Major is clear in it ſelf, and may be further evidenced from the connexion betwixt the 16. and 17. verſes. The Minor is thus confirmed, The Jewes were fallen from that holineſs, and the natural branches broken off, which they were capable to looſe; but it was outward Covenant holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, from whence the Jewes were fallen, and they were capable to looſe, therefore it was outward Covenant holineſs, from whence the Jewes were fallen, and the natural bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches broken off. The Minor again is thus proved, either they were liable to looſe outward Covenant holyneſs, or inward holineſs according to election, but not inward holineſs according to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, therefore outward Covenant-holineſs. Not inward
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:45475:119"/> holyneſs according to election, then the immortal ſeed would dye, the gifts, and graces of God were not without repentance, thoſe whom God juſtifies, them he would not glorifie, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 30 Which is to comply with the Papiſts, Pelagians, and Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants. Secondly that holineſs is here meant according to which the branches of the wild olive were graffed in, but it was covenant-holineſs according to which the branches of the wild olive were graffed in, therefore outward Covenant-holines is here meant. That it was outward Covenant-holineſs according to which the branches of the wild olive were graffed in, appears in that it was viſible (which that according to election is not) the branches were viſibly broken off, they were viſibly graffed in, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                     <p>Fourthly that holineſs is here meant, according to which the body of the Jewes ſhall be graffed in again, but it is covenant-ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs according to which the body of the Jewes ſhall be graffed in again, therefore covenant-holineſs is here meant.

                        </gap>s not meant of matrimonial holineſs. He denyes the conſequence, which is proved thus, If God forbid the holy ſeed to mingle with none but them that are unholy (which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets baſtards) then it will follow, the holy ſeed, that is, the lawfully begotten Jewes have mingled themſelves with the ſeed of thoſe lands, that is, the baſtards of thoſe lands, but God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids the holy ſeed to mingle with none but them that are unholy, therefore it will follow the holy ſeed, that is the lawfully begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Jewes have mingled themſelves with the ſeed of thoſe lands, that is the baſtards of thoſe lands: The conſequence is evident, If God forbid them to mingle with none but thoſe that are ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtards in his ſenſe, the meaning is, the legitimate of the Jewes have mingled with the baſtards of the lands. The Minor, that God forbids the holy ſeed to mingle with none but them that are unholy is apparent from the oppoſition implyed in the Text, the holy ſeed have mingled themſelvs with the people, which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues the Jewes had that holineſs the people had not, otherwiſe the ſpeech would be incongruous, and the people might reply; we, if it be but meant of legitimation, are as holy as you; and that the Jewes had a particular outward holineſs, which other Nati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

That God hath clenſed call not thou common,</hi> that is count not thou the Gentiles unholy, whom God intends henceforth to graff into the ſtock of the natural o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, and to eſteem them holy; holy now all potentially, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a capacity (the partitian wall being pulled down) actually
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:45475:121"/> when they give their names to Chriſt: So that the ſenſe is not (as he ſayes) the holy ſeed, that is, thoſe who were deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by lawfull generation of allowed women, theſe have taken to themſelves of the daughters of the Nations whom God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad them to marry; but thus, the holy ſeed, that is, the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites that are in Covenant with God have taken to themſelves of the daughters of the nations whom God forbad them to marry, being not in covenant with him, which is plain out of the verſes 1, 2. So that I confeſſe the people of the land, with whom they mingled themſelves, are not conſidered as illegitimate in their birth, though that will inevitably follow from the antitheſis, (if his interpretation be admitted) but as not allowed to the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, who were to marry none, but they that were holy, and in Covenant; Therefore the Nations are not ſimply excluded as ſuch, but as unproſelyted. And the holy ſeed is not that ſeed which by a right generation according to <hi>Moſes</hi> Law was legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate; Then thoſe Apoſtate Jewes, husbands and wives we read of in <hi>Buxtorfius</hi> and <hi>Maymonides</hi> being by a right generation, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Moſe</hi> Law legitimate, were a holy ſeed, for all they uncircumciſed themſelves, than which nothing can be more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, and all the Jews perſiſting in covenant, whether legitimate or illegitimate were a holy ſeed.</p>
                     <p>Hence reſults this Argument. That holy ſeed is not here meant in which the contrary thereof even baſtards are comprehended, but baſtards are comprehended under holy ſeed, therefore legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is not here meant: The Minor is apparent, becauſe it is ſpoken to the whole Congregation, whereof ſome were Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtards, and baſtard Iſraelites mingling with the Nations, had joyned an unholy ſeed with a holy, and fell under this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof.</p>
                     <p>What Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> talks of <hi>Jepthe</hi> makes him guilty of that he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes others, of running like <hi>Ahimaaz</hi> without his errand, and fighting like the <hi>Antabatae</hi> with his eyes ſhut, for he never eyes the Queſtion, which was not of <hi>Jephthe</hi>'s ſaintſhip according to election, but covenant-holineſs, for all he was illegitimate in his birth, which gave him capacity to circumciſion, and other peculiar ordinances of Gods people, whereby (as the means) he attained to be a Saint, and juſtified by faith, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. To this Argument, <hi>Moſes</hi> had children by the Aethiopian woman, but they were not illegitimate, Therefore thoſe that were begot by mixture with the Nations, were not illegitimate, he grants the premiſes, and implyedly the concluſion, which is contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:45475:121"/> to his, for all he ſayes that the Aethiopian woman was not forbidden; Not forbidden, he means when he marryed her by that poſitive Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. 3. but long before her death, why by virtue of that might not ſhe, and her children be put away, as well as thoſe in <hi>Ezra</hi>'s, and <hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s time? But were there not other lawes before that to keep their tribes entire without prophane mixture? Nay viſible remainders in the Law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for breach of which God with indignation expreſſes <hi>Gen. 6. 2. And the Sons of God ſaw the daughters of men that they were faire, and they took them wives of all they choſe.</hi> It was according to this light that <hi>Gen.</hi> 27. 46.

                     <hi>THe laſt Argument Mr.</hi> C. <hi>uſed was this; They that Chriſt took up in his arms, bleſſed, and ſaid the Kingdom of God belongeth unto them, pronounced a curſe upon thoſe that deſpiſed, and would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, are holy with a Covenant-holineſs; But Chriſt took up little children into his arms, bleſſed them, ſaid, the Kingdom of God belonged unto them, pronounced a curſe upon thoſe that deſpiſed, and would not receive them: Therefore little children are holy with a Covenant holineſs, In this Argument I denyed the Minor, after ſome debate about the way of forming of it, in which I magined that fallacy, I do not now upon ſight deprehend, and particularly I denyed that Christ pronounced a curſe upon thoſe that deſpiſed, and would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them. Then he alledged</hi> Matth. 18. 2. <hi>Whence he argued, They to whom belongs the Kingdom of Heaven are holy, and in Covenant. But to little children belongs the Kingdom of Heaven; Therefore little children are holy, and in Covenant. In which Argument any Reader may perceive he proved not that I denyed, That Chriſt pronounced a curſe upon thoſe that deſpiſed, and would not receive little children, or Infants, and yet that Text he alledged did not ſay of little cildren, that to them belongs the Kingdom of Heaven, but thoſe that were not to be offended</hi> v. 6. <hi>deſpiſed</hi> v. 10. <hi>were to be received in Christs name,</hi> v. 5. <hi>were not little children in age, but little ones in ſpirit, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in that they are ſaid to be Believers</hi> v. 6. <hi>and to be converted and become as little children. To which as the Relator himſelf ſets it down, Mr.</hi> C. <hi>ſaid, the meaning is not, that the little children are converted, which is a grant of what I alledged, that the little ones not to be offended, despiſed, but received, were not little children in age, but affection of humility. Mr.</hi> C. <hi>added, But it hath relation to the diſciples in the firſt verſe, who must be converted from their actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſins, and become as little children, which have no actuall ſin. At which words it is true I ſaid, and that justly, o how unhappy are the people that are ſeduced with theſe toyes, are you not aſhamed? To which he replyed, and it ſeems is not aſhamed that it is printed, [I ſee nothing worthy of ſhame] whereas if this ſpeech of his were true, then this is a truth, except men be converted from their actuall ſins, and become as little children, which have no actual ſin, they ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven: for this is the meaning of Chriſts words,</hi>

                     <p>IT was further evidenced, (which he calls the laſt Argument) that Infants were holy with a Covenant-holineſs thus, they that Chriſt took up in his armes, bleſſed, ſaid the Kingdom of God belonged unto them, pronounced a curſe upon thoſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed, and would not receive them are holy with a Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holineſs: But Chriſt took up little children into his armes, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them, ſaid the Kingdom of God belongeth unto them, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth a curſe upon thoſe that deſpiſeth and would not receive them; Therefore little children are holy with a covenant holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. In this Argument (he ſayes) he denyed the Minor, and after ſome debate about the way of forming of it, he imagined that fallacy, he does not now upon ſight deprehend; It is well he acknowledges he hath not the ſpirit of infallibility, he that ſees his miſtake in this one propoſition, may have his eyes further opened, to diſcover his errour in the whole controverſie: His miſtakes were two, 1. In ſaying it was a fallacie of heaping ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particulars together, 2 a copulative propoſition, that if one member of it was falſe, the whole was falſe, but for theſe, his retra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation makes amends, if he had not linked two untruthes unto it, Firſt that he particularly denyed that Chriſt pronounced a curſe upon thoſe that deſpiſed little children, and that, that was to be proved, Secondly, that I alledged <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 2. for clearing of which, the Reader is to be advertized, that I having told him, it was not an explicite copulative propoſition, neither was any member of it falſe, ſeeing every branch of it was Scripture, I fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preſſed him to inſtance in any of the particulars, that he thought made the leaſt for me, and I would begin with that; whereupon he (not I) mentioned, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 2. whence I drew this Argument; They to whom belongs the Kingdome of Heaven are holy, and in Covenant, but to little children belongs the kingdome of Heaven, therefore little Children are holy, and in covenant. By this any reader may percieve I proved that which was to be proved; And for that other part of the propoſition, that Chriſt pronounced a curſe upon thoſe that deſpiſed, and would not receive little children, or Infants, I promiſed to prove
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:45475:123"/> that alſo in it order, and would have endeavoured by Gods aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, if the time, and his patience would have permitted, which will fall in anon; for the preſent he implyes a denyall of my Minor, ſaying the Text I alledged, did not ſay of little children, that to them belongs the Kingdom of Heaven, but thoſe that were not to be offended <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. deſpiſed <hi>v.</hi> 10. were to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in Chriſts name <hi>v.</hi> 5. were not little children in age, but little ones in ſpirit, which appeared in that they are ſaid to be believers, <hi>v.</hi> 6. and to be converted, and become as little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.

That Chriſt ſaid that of that little babe too that he took in his armes, and ſet in the midſt of them, <hi>he that receiveth this little

                     <p>THe firſt Argument is, Thoſe (meaning under the Goſpell) that are in Covenant with God, (meaning outward, and viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,) ought to have the ſeal of the Covenant which is Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; But Infants of believing parents are in Covenant with God, therefore they ought to have the ſeal of the Covenant which is Baptiſm. The former propoſition I truely ſayd is firm by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of all Divines, even our adverſaries, meaning Mr. <hi>T.</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, whoſe, Plea for Antipaed. <hi>page</hi> 12. confeſſes he affirmed in his ſermon that viſible Church-members were to be baptized, viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church-members, and viſible Covenanters are Synonima; And that thoſe that were actually received into Covenant might be Baptized; to be viſibly in covenant, and actually received into covenant, are both one.</p>
                     <p>I cited five more, four eminent Proteſtants <hi>Danaeus Davenant, Wendel,</hi> and <hi>Perkings;</hi> One a Papiſt, <hi>Ferus,</hi> who he ſayes, is more ingenuous than them that are fore-mentioned, ſee his affection; and (if you pleaſe) <hi>Ferus</hi> his ingenuity, who upon <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. ſayth, <hi>juſte, ac vere ex ſpiritu Chriſti eccleſiae etiam pueros baptizat, non igitur Chriſtianum, ſed plane Herodianum, vel ſi mavis, Egyptia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum eſt parvulos populi Dei necare,</hi> Juſtly and truely from the ſpirit of God, the Church even baptizeth children; therefore it is not a Chriſtan act, but plainly like <hi>Herod,</hi> or rather like the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians to murder the little ones of Gods people by denying them Baptiſm. I think we muſt take that for true, which is inſtituted by Chriſt, practiſed by the Apoſtles, and all ſucceeding ages, adhere to Scriptures, not the writings of a few novel Anabaptiſts, whoſe dictats poyſons the Church. I knew that Mr. <hi>T.</hi> who will not take upon him the name of a Divine, yet thinks himſelf wiſer than all the Divines in the World, hath denyed and attempted to prove Exam. part 3. <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. letter to Mr. <hi>Bayly Sect.</hi> 3.

                     <p>My arguing is good, and proves Infants are wronged, that have not Baptiſm the initiating ſeal, but not ſo, if they have not the Communion, becauſe they cannot examine themſelves?

                     <p>THE Minor I prove from <hi>Geneſis</hi> 17. 7. where the Infants of believing Parents are implyed, it being a covenant not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſtabliſhed with <hi>Abraham,</hi> but with his ſeed after him in their generations for an everlaſting covenant, by virtue of which <hi>Iſack,</hi> and all ſucceeding Male-Infants were circumciſed. I ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Cornelius a Lapide</hi> (which he does often) though a Jeſuit, not to prove the point, but the harmony of learned men againſt the new fangle Anabaptiſt; the tranſlation of whoſe words, though miſtaken in a ſillable by the Relator, or Printer, makes for me, for both the words, and Context proves prerogative of birth to believers Infants to the end of the World. In <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 8. There is implyed <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, in that it was a Goſpell-covenant, and that in him all Nations ſhall be bleſſed, and is directly for me, for it aſſerts the covenant, and in that juſtification to the believing Gentiles, not onely from <hi>Abrahams</hi> promiſe, but alſo a promiſe to them, and their ſeed. I confeſs <hi>Iſaak</hi> was in covenant with God internally, that is as he interprets, a child of promiſe, not onely when he was but eight dayes old, but before the ſeventh; but we ſpeak of a viſible covenant, which he at leaſt compleatly entered not till by circumciſion the eight day; which outward ſeal, I ſay meaning circumciſion, as well as the inward circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:45475:137"/> of the heart, he had by the virtue, or in the virtue of the lamb to be ſlain; And is no ſtrange Divinity to them, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Chriſt the Angel, and Mediator of the covenant, both to hear and read, that every perſon was circumciſed by virtue of Chriſts death, as the Meritorius, as well as by reaſon of Gods command the efficient cauſe; To looke at any circumſtance of the covenant of grace out of Chriſt, or not receiving virtue from Chriſt, is too looke in a glaſſe wherein we may ſee our own dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.

                     <hi>HIs ſecond Argument is, ſuch as were circumciſed under the Law, may be baptized under the Goſpel; But infants of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers were circumciſed under the Law; Therefore they may be baptized under the Goſpel.

Circumciſion did bind to the keeping of the Law, but never that I find is the grace of God ſaid to be either phyſically, or morally conferred by the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of each perſon rightly circumciſed. 2. It ſuppoſeth, if infants be not baptized, the grace of God is ſtraiter in the new Teſtament, than in the old. But that is falſe; for the grace of God is as much without Sacraments, as with it. Above two thouſand years before</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>was circumciſed, there was neither circumciſion, nor baptiſm of infants, nor any other Sacrament inſtead thereof; ſhall we ſay that Gods grace was ſtraiter before</hi> Abraham'<hi>s time than ſince?

<pb n="266" facs="tcp:45475:142"/> therefore they are in covenant, whereas this is as true of Infidel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Children as of Chriſtians, and therefore proves the one in covenant as well as the other, and both theſe acts of little Children are onely naturall, not virtuous, and ſo give not evidence of their being in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; nor doth the Goſpel give them large commendations beyond them of riper years, making them the rule of our perfection: for there is neither commendation of them,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 2. <hi>nor</hi> Math. 18. 3. <hi>nor making them the rule of our perfection, any more than Sheep, and Doves,</hi> Math. 10. 16. <hi>But onely thoſe virtuous qualities, which are reſembled by their naturall qualities, are propounded to us as our rule.

                     <p>THe third Argument riſing thence, hath its unanſwerable ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility thence; which was this; Thoſe that were in covenant, had the ſeal of the covenant, and were never disfranchized, and put out of covenant, have title to the Covenant, and ſeal of it ſtill; But infants were once in Covenant, had the ſeal of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and were never disfranchized, and put out of Covenant, Therefore infants have title to the Covenant, and ſeal of it ſtill.

It is true, that God requires no more of Infants in Covenant, and born of believing Parents, to their baptiſm, but a meer objective power, or receptibility, as the world in its Creation was of nothing, ſo infants regeneration, or new creature is of nothing. It is alſo a divine truth, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account I ſpake of, many whole families accepting Chriſt were baptized, and their infants with them, which the Texts I alledged in the Sermon, proves, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 47.

                     <p>MY firſt Argument was, They that are capable of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and bleſſing which is the greater, are capable of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm which is the leſſer; But infants of believers are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the Kingdom, and bleſſing which is the greater; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are capable of baptiſm, which is the leſſer. The Major is true being underſtood Relatively (as he knew it ought to be) of the inward ſpirituall grace ſignified by outward waſhing, They that are capable of inward baptiſm which is the greater, are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of outward baptiſm the leſs. This he confeſſes often, and that if he knew, he would baptize them, what can hinder water that theſe may be baptized, ſeeing they have received the Holy Ghoſt? But it does not follow, that becauſe they are capable of the Kingdom, and bleſſing which is the greater, Therefore they are capable of the Lords Supper, Ordination to the Miniſtery, Church Diſcipline, which are the leſſer; for theſe are heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal, and not by any divine inſtitution appointed to ſignify, or Seal the other. We receive the Lords Supper, not as capable of the Kingdom, and to be matriculated, but as proficients in the Kingdom in a further graduall perfection. Ordination of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, Church Diſcipline relates not ſtrictly to the Kingdom, and bleſſing, as Kingdom, but accidentally in outward ſeparable reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, and circumſtances. I confeſs according to Gods ſecret will it is poſſible, that infants of unbelievers may be admitted by God into the Kingdom of Heaven without any viſible expreſſion, but we are to depend upon Gods revealed will, who hath given no promiſe but to Covenanters, believers, and their ſeed, who are admitted into the Church without any viſible Teſtimony of their actuall faith.

                     <p>MY ſeventh Argument was, All that have faith may be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed; Some Infants have faith; Therefore ſome Infants may be baptized. The major may have a threefold acceptation, 1. All that have faith conferred, or to be conferred in Baptiſm, though not Phyſically, or morally, or <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> yet of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine promiſe, as ſome hold, all believers Infants have, becauſe they cannot <hi>ponere obicem;</hi> it will inevitably follow, theſe (if ſuch) are baptizeable. 2. All that have faith of the parents, or ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties imputed to them, as in the old Cathechiſm, they do perform by their ſureties, who do promiſe and vow them both (faith and repentance) in their names, this granted makes Infants bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zable. 3. All that have faith in feed, ſecret act, or habit, may be baptized; this he onely inſiſts upon, denying it, becauſe it is not made known, confeſſing oft, if it were known, he would baptize them; this exception denies not, but they are baptiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but that he may not baptize them, as if God had given them a right to baptiſm, and no means to attain it, and concludes as well againſt baptiſm of elders; for if he baptize none, till
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:45475:147"/> their faith be made known, he muſt ſuperſede till this mortal put on immortallity: It is falſe that I alter the concluſion, which in the diſpute was, ſome Infants may be baptized: In the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon indefinitly, Infants may be baptized, ſometimes, as the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unm affords, I extend it to believers Infants, yea unbelievers, if under Chriſtian education, but the loweſt is ſufficient to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw his Tenet, who denies all Infant-baptiſm. Its but his dream, that I have any need to avouch all Infants of believers have ſaith at leaſt, <hi>in ſemine,</hi> and I think it hard for him to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt the contrary from Scripture, and experience; All that maintain an impoſſibility of falling from grace <hi>in adultis,</hi> does not ſo in ſeminal graces in Infants, but I wave that.</p>
                     <p>The Minor I proved from <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. where Chriſt expreſly calls little children in age (as many interpret it) believers, from the authority of <hi>Luke,</hi> who Chapter 9. 48. ſayes; Chriſt ſayes that of the little babe he took up in his armes, and ſet in the midſt of them, <hi>he that receiveth this little child in my name, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth me, Mark</hi> 9. 36. 37. he that recieveth one of theſe little children, without mention of any other foregoing, but the child it ſelf taken into his arms, receiveth me; However little children were patterns, they were to imitate in faith and humility, <hi>propter quod unumquodque tale, illud magis tale.</hi> It is not ridiculous, but rather blaſphemous to ſay it is ridiculous to threaten ſo heavy a doom to the offending, or ſcandalizing of little children in age, whom he childiſhly, and untruly ſayes are offended with none ſo much as nurſes for dreſſing or chiding them, when they cry: Mr. <hi>T.</hi> might know that <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

This he grants, that Infants are ſaid to receive the Kingdom of God, <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 10. that is, the grace of God, remiſſion of ſins, and life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, now the kingdom is not received but by faith in Chriſt, Elect Infants dying do receive the eternal kingdom either by faith in the ſeed, not in the act, or by faith in the act ſecret only, and yet are to be baptized, before they make profeſſion, upon their birthright priviledge grounded on Gods promiſe, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>THey pleaſe God, therefore declaratively (not cauſally) Chriſt bleſſeth them, it being impoſſible without faith to pleaſe God. The Argument (but far unlike) is urged by the Remonſtrants at the Synod at Dort, to prove foreſight of faith in time to be the cauſe of election before time; I ſpeak of Infants that are in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and actually pleaſe God, and receive his benediction, which preſuppoſeth their perſons are accepted, and they have faith, theſe two differ <hi>toto coelo. Hebr. 11. 6. Enoch</hi> pleaſed God by faith, manifeſting it ſelf by works in walking with him, which Infants cannot do, at leaſt in that degree, and manner; yet are not therefore without faith; God loved them, as elect, from eternity, with a love of intention, but not before they were in being, and had faith, with a love of execution, which he expreſſed by bleſſing of them. I ſaid from Scripture-grounds that faith muſt be allowed them, or ſalvation denyed them, but the latter was cruell, and impious, therefore the former muſt be godly and pious, faith onely purifieth the heart <hi>Acts 15. 9. and no unclean thing ſhall enter into Heaven;</hi> This he grants, ſaying
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:45475:148"/> faith in the ſeed is ſufficient to make them clean, which is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, may be in Infants; But denies that <hi>Iſai.</hi> 65. 20. ſayes any ſuch thing; the contrary whereof hath been formerly proved. He takes no notice of the Teſtimonies of <hi>Paraeus, Hommius, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za, Trelcatius,</hi> and <hi>Voſſius,</hi> but girds at <hi>Austin,</hi> who to <hi>Pelagius</hi> asking him, where he places Infants baptized, anſwers <hi>in numero credentium,</hi> in the number of believers, and addes, <hi>nec judicare aliter ullo modo audebis, ſi non vis eſſe apertè haereticus,</hi> neither may thou preſume to judge otherwiſe, if thou wilt not be a plain he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick; to ſhake of this load that is laid in the right ſaddle, he ſayes <hi>Auſtins</hi> words expreſſes nothing, but his own conceit accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the language of the time; when as indeed it is the language of Scripture, and all ages, ſaving <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Leyden</hi>'s, when he was backed with the German Boars, and this preſent, when by reaſon of our late diſtractions, the hedge of diſcipline was broken down; Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> to get him a name with <hi>Eroſtratus,</hi> took liberty to advance alſo his Idol, thought Antipaedobaptiſm moſt plauſible, whereas according to all antiquity, faith in ſeed, or act unknown, with Covenant-holineſs doth intitle to baptiſm.</p>

The abſurdities are theſe, Infants would be looſers by Chriſts coming, and in worſe condition than the Jewiſh Infants were, they with the parents were admitted to the ſeal of the Covenant, which was Circumciſion, and not parents with children to baptiſm. Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his Anſwer is frivolous, and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, ſaying, he rather thinks that by being not admitted to circumciſion the condition of parents, and children is the better by Chriſts coming; which I grant, but it is nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; our condition under the Goſpel is better than theirs under
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:45475:149"/> the Law, theirs under the law infinitly better than the heathens, which had not circumciſion the ſeal of the righteouſneſs of faith; Chriſtians Infants, if they had not baptiſm, were worſe than Jewes Infants, no better than Pagans. Circumciſion was the yoke <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 10. of which the Apoſtle ſaid, neither we nor our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were able to bear it, that ſeale, or ordinance by which the Jewes were bound to obſerve the ceremonial Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and yet a rite that under that troubleſome Oconomy ſealed the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of faith in Chriſt to come, baptiſm under an eaſier yoke ſeals Chriſt that is come.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, its acknowledged; though Baptiſm, and other Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments be pure Evangelical priviledges, yet they are not ſuch priviledges, but parents, and children did well without them, as well as without Scriptures before <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time, &amp; all the femals from <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time, till Chriſt, that were without actual<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>THe ſecond abſurdity was, If Infants ſhould be in covenant then and not now, grace would be larger under the Law, than under the Goſpel, which his Anſwer does not reach; for the Queſtion is not of extending means of ſalvation to Gentiles, not proſeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but independent of the Jewes, which by degrees were multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, as was before from <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſole family to a great nation ſurpaſſing in number the ſands of the ſea; But whether all ſexes, ages, degrees be in covenant, which were before, from which if Infants were excluded till actual profeſſors, the one half of Chriſtendom would be excommunicated, whereas <hi>Bucer</hi> ſaith on <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. that no age affordeth heaven ſo many Citizens as infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.

                        </gap> for their ſins. It is a malitious ſlander that we make them odious that will not bury, that is, officiate at the burial of the dead, in which ſome of us may challenge precedency of Maſter <hi>Tombes,</hi> who turned not with (and its to be feared, for) the times, as he, but prevented them: yet we cannot be perſwaded Chriſts burial ought to be a more neceſſary preſident than his death, for ours, till he can prove the Jewiſh burial rites,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:45475:150"/> and amongſt them, thoſe that dyed as Malefactors, to be our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory; for then he muſt bury his friends out of Towns, Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, or Church-yard, in the fields, in rocks, or caves, and not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them with Earth: we know not from Scripture to put any difference between believers, and Pagans children, unleſs the one be in viſible covenant, and may have the ſeal, whereas the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are without them; God hath made no promiſe to any that are out of viſible covenant. And if the hope fullneſs of our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren without the covenant, or promiſe, depend onely upon our prayers, education, example, ſociety; Their condition even in this alſo, is no better than of Infidels children, who if they ſhould live amongſt us, ought to participate of all theſe, which we ought not to be contented withall, ſeeing God hath enlarged his bounty further, but complain of them who deny infants thoſe reall, and Scripture-grounded priviledges, which would conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently (for any thing we know) deprive them both of grace, and glory.</p>
                     <p>We look upon children of believers, that die unbaptized through invincible neceſſity, as hopefull; deſpair not wholly of Anabaptiſts children, that through Parents contempt are not baptized; It may be, he that ſaid <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 17. 14.

And methinks Mr. <hi>T.</hi> might be aſhamed to uſe this forgery, when he had my words before him, to ſay I ſaid, The children of Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts are as vile, as the children of <hi>Turks Tartars</hi> and <hi>Cannibals,</hi> when my words were expreſly, all the Infants of Chriſtians (if they were out of covenant) would be as vile, as the children of <hi>Turks, Tartars,</hi> and <hi>Cannibals;</hi> I hope all Chriſtians are not Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, and for the Parents to contemne the ſeal, though com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, is not ſimply to put the children out of covenant. This is not to affright the poore ignorant people (as he further tradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces me) as the Popiſh prieſts did of old with a Limbo or Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of Infants, but to tell them their danger, who detract from, or diminiſh the word, and inſtitution of Chriſt, and make the way and entrance into the Church narrower than God hath made it.</p>

                     <p>THe fourth Abſurdity was, If Chriſtian Infants were without viſible covenant, and conſequently baptiſm, they would be without God, without Chriſt, without hope in the World, not the children of God, but of the Devill, would all be damned, for out of the covenant, and viſible Church (ordinarily) there is ſalvation; which his anſwer does not impeach, for by covenant I mean outward covenant, which is not onely (nor properly at all)
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:45475:151"/> baptiſm; but foederall holyneſs, that (as the Directory ſayes) gives capacity thereto; By denying of both of them, they put them out of covenant, and my ſpeech implyes, that denyall of viſible covenantſhip, foederall holyneſs, and baptiſm, infers all this; which comes far ſhort of that the Epiſtle relates, and the Examiner confeſſes, he delivered in his Sermon, for he affirmed, there was no hope of ſalvation to thoſe that were baptized when Infants, if they were not baptized again, that is, that contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a ſecond baptiſm, as his neceſſity of precept infers; which neceſſity I onely underſtand for baptiſm of Infants, and conceive that <hi>Auſtin</hi> was called a hard Father of Infants, for ſometimes holding as well a neceſſity of means, as precept. But Anabaptiſts denye not onely the ſeal, but foederall holyneſs, and viſible Church-memberſhip to Infants: This I delivered in the Sermon with the ſpirit of truth, and meekeneſs, which for Mr. <hi>T.</hi> to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, and aggravate (as he does) becomes no profeſſed Chriſtian, much leſs a Miniſter of the Goſpell.</p>

Infants of believers are neither negatively, nor privatively out of the Church viſible, for neither want of age to underſtand the faith, nor ability to make profeſſion excludes them more now, than it did the Jewes children under the Law, who were ordinarily, that is, according to Gods promiſe annexed to the covenant, ſaved; If any Gentiles children un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſelyted, were ſaved, it was extraordinarily, that is, without promiſe, or viſible covenant.

I make no doubt, but the Antiſcripturians will ſay as much of the Bible, and the Ranters of marriage. But what are his corruptions Infant-baptiſm hath brought in? 1. Private baptiſm; Anſw. as if we might not as well baptize In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants in houſes, As the Apoſtle did the Jayler; or two or three of them ſteal to a river ſide to duck, or cuck a Proſelyte. 2. Baptiſm by women. Anſw. Proteſtant Churches allowes no ſuch thing ſince Luther, but cloſes with the Councell of <hi>Carthage Can. 10. Mulier baptizare non praeſumat,</hi> let not a woman preſume to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize; Bold <hi>Zippora</hi> circumciſing muſt be no preſident. 3. Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of Infants not yet brought into light. Anſw. If he mean the mother with child, Councells are againſt it, If he mean the child, we know no ſuch approbation, or practice 4. Baptiſm of children of uncertain progeny, Anſw. we approve, and know of none, if the Parents be not believers, and Chriſtians engage for them. 5. They are baptized in the name of the Lord, that know not the Lord. Anſw. As well as Jewiſh Infants circumciſed with the ſeal of righteouſneſs of faith in Chriſt, who knew not Chriſt. 6. It ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits the ignorant, and prophane to the Lords ſupper, becauſe the ſacraments are concommitants. Anſw. The Antecedent, and conſequent are both Scriptureleſs, and falſe, the one is the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of initiation, the other of perfection, to which the former is a preparative: 7 It. perverts the order of diſcipline, by baptizing before Catechizing. Anſw. In Infants it does, as in Iſaack, and the Jewes males, but not <hi>in adultis,</hi> and what inconvenience? 8. Its turned to a feaſt, and men forget baptiſm. Anſw. There was a feaſt at the weaning of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and feaſts of charity at the Lords Supper without prophaneſs; we can minde at ripe years what was bequeathed us by Legacy when we were Infants, may we not as well our ſolemn vow which we are put in minde of dayly? Thus his vainly pretended errours and corruptions vaniſh, without impeaching the bleſſed ſucceſs of Infant-baptiſm ſince the Apoſtles; which briefly here I drew down from the Apoſtles times, more largely before, beginning with the words of <hi>Dionyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> the Areopagite, whom the Apoſtles converted at <hi>Athens;</hi> who ſaid, Holy men have received a Tradition from the Fathers, that

Geneſ.</hi> 17, 7, And this comfort ſprings from Gods promiſe foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in Chriſts merits, conveyed by covenant-holineſs or birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priviledge, ſealed by baptiſm, layd hold on by faith of Parents; ſometimes faith in the ſeed, or ſecret act of Infants; which to enjoy, and be diſobedient to the precept, and practice of Infant-Baptiſm
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:45475:156"/> is a ridiculous conceit: for Infant-Baptiſm brings not with it a meer empty title, but obedience, which is better than ſacrifice, and the benefit comes no more without Baptiſm, than clenſing of <hi>Naamans</hi> leproſie without waſhing in <hi>Jordan.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly much benefit comes to Infants by Baptiſm, which the Devil knows well, when he cauſes Witches to renounce their Baptiſm when they enter into Covenant with him; for they are thereby admitted into the boſome of the Church, devoted, &amp; conſecrated unto God, his name is put upon them, they wear his royall badge, and by it they are diſtinguiſhed from Heathens, and this ſo clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from Scriptures truly, and ſpiritually underſtood, that the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevaile againſt it: This he paſſes by, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving one gird at Witches, ſaying, the Devils dealing makes it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear the faith is good into which the pretended Baptiſm is, but not that the Baptiſm is right: Nay rather, if Infant Baptiſm (as he ſays) be a nullity, mockery, will-worſhip, They ſhould ſtick to it, for therein the Devill delights; he might as well ſay, The Devill cauſes Popiſh Conjurers (when they enter into Covenant with him) to renounce Baptizing of Bells, worſhipping of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, becauſe driving away Devils, the end of the one, and adoring the prototype the deſign of the other, is good.</p>
